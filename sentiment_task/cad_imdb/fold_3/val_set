2836	This film  goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. I thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, and, sure enough, as it goes on, it doesn't matter that you don't entirely know what's going on. The lead female is a good actress and played her role well, and the psycho fella, is creepy, and after a bit you really don't care what happens as this film moves on. Great really, this could have turned out a lot worse.Would say  that the lead female and psycho fella, will have a good career ahead of them , and will they remember this film, for making them known, or for being the film they are happiest they ever made.	1	This film just goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, but it just drags on and on, and eventually you don't know what's going on. The lead female is a good actress and played her role well, and the psycho fella, is creepy, but after a bit you don't really care what happens, because this film just drags on. Shame really, this could have turned out a lot better.Would say though that the lead female and psycho fella, will have a good career ahead of them , but will they remember this film, for making them known, or for being the film they regret they ever made.	0
19137	Plato's run is an entertaining b movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to.Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what i liked about Plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10	1	Plato's run is an unenjoyable movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was wrong to.Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what i liked about Plato's run was the way the film consistently got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still bad the acting was boring to watch and the action was quite bland as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is bad as Plato's sidekick Jeff Speaksman makes a bad performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato's run is an unenjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 1 out of 10	0
17710	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which isn't great to see and it shows how little human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.Overall terrible  movie even if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.	0	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was.

9001	"The wonderful ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after ""Butterfly"". I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from great to obviously GREATER in this film.Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work had been exalted by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann complimented him (she loved his way of writing women), just while Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who also made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books. Which is why this work is wonderful. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just caught on with audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire. The supporting cast was not a hindrance either.Oooooh... this was delightful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even better. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all came true when this was done. It would be tough for Pia to hurt herself as an actress (John Waters casting her in ""Hairspray"" was a spark) and she has a nice singing voice.Hey, Pia, wherever you are...Hairspray may go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest comeback story yet.I just hope they rerelease this film for ya if you do."	1	"The wonderful ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after ""Butterfly"".

6414	"Yes, this movie is good. What's even better is that it takes advantage of its title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other more than ONCE . On top of that, the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" nonetheless it ends up being brilliant move. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR and the scenes that take place anywhere else are even better. Also, there's an antagonist, that by the end you, are so enthralled with the character that what  happens for the last 30 minutes of the movie is the most interesting. However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was great  and instrumented (with either an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). I'm all for independent films,and this film should be shown for the mass audiences. ""Better than Scarecrow slayer."""	1	"Yes, this movie is bad.

1424	We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this emotional play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy. They ponder the results. He mumbles some more, she composes another eulogy, etc., etc.The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad and the dramatization is a reminder of all we have lost but all we have learned. It's a great movie.	1	We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge.

2124	After the opening credits, there's a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower.Then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after much padding, they hit something and skid off the road. They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring.The killings are sadly very tame for a supposed Video Nasty. The twist ending silly and predictable.

5783	I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue I've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it.This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.	0	I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy.

9064	What can I say about Cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will certainly watch this film again, without being fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.The film 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose spot-on impression of Ryan Phillipe made me smile throughout. In a case of good casting, Dunne attempts (and succeeds) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is incredibly handsome, charismatic and charming, the character is left wholly believable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life... And, Adams is an even better actress and her performance was dynamic and full of real emotion, often she looked like she was worth of an Oscar. There were two other good actors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the reason why I rated the film as a 10, not a 9.The film itself is a good version of the original, with such highs as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which saluted the originality of the previous film.I think that as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it was recasted with the same cast in the main parts.	1	What can I say about Cruel intentions 2?

19737	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not laugh once. Nothing about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie whatsoever, but for what it is supposed to be it is still horrible. It gets no meaning across. The cast is maybe as bad as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are boring. For this who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a lackluster bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you not to see this movie.	0	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing.

6136	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.** out of ****	0	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is hardly a mixed bag for slasher fans.

21589	"This is where the term ""classic film"" doesn't originate from. This is an unwatchable story of a woman's attempt at bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her. (Yeah right, A PEARL!!) Luise Rainer was the average star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in ""The Great Zigfield"". It really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her subpar beauty. But in ""Good Earth"" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. People say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. Like, completely. Her character Olan is a shy and timid woman, with no inner strength. She is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. If you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film, you are correct!Paul Muni shows that he can't act also. His character is not a likeable one to me. He never sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty.

19079	"This interesting Giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but it was released in Germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title ""Horror House"". At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. But the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.A convincing Giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"" is highly recommended to Giallo fans and slightly superior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller."	1	"This disgusting Giallo boasts a typical and disturbing plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.Directed by Emilio P.

There is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene.

I actually watched the entire thing simply because I couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects. Also, if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects. This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as ""Blair Witch"" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything.

5434	"This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and ""with it"" to be understood by us mortals."	0	"This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely  dialog or plot of  sort.

16139	A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist, warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. His wife, who supports totally her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she received an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. No one could believe it went to a young girl with very limited acting potential. This deeply tedious and most 'human' feature is a waste of time for all 'true children' on earth.	0	A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist, warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life.

9354	"Why review good movies when you can review ""Trancers II?""Ooh, this film is soooo lame. I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, hurling extras in silly monster make-up at poor, long-suffering Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon couldn't afford ""real"" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots - this must be classic Trancers!And yet...and yet...it rules. Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable""? Well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still good stuff.My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks up the joint. She's a lousy rival for Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more. Oh well, you can't have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the ""long second watch"" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the least-convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in ""Creator"").I haven't seen this lately, but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle. Hooray for lousy continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film."	0	"Why review bad movies when you can review ""Trancers II?""Ooh, this film is soooo good.

926	It's a poor film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the least and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes. People get stabbed and they GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch poor horror films, I recommend this one highly.	0	It's a great film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes.

21658	I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was not palatable while being morbid. The characters weren't engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying.Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are not good and unbelievable. I disliked how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I disliked the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him.All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the least valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has no romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can end.	0	I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private.

This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la ""War of the Worlds""), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast."	0	"This film is great.

21974	"I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as ""Away from Her"" - or even ""The Bucket List"" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene!This isn't a ""feel good"" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel."	1	"I saw the movie recently and really hated it. I surprised myself and cried.

19006	I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrific TV movie.Vote: 9	1	I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a critic very quickly.

18898	The arrival of a world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is exhausting and makes you leave the cinema with both a frown on your face and tears in your eyes. It's about bringing out the best in people but Kay Pollak has written a miserable script, even though it was based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors are lackluster; Michael Nyqvist we knew before but Frida Hallgren was an new, and unimpressive acquaintances to me. She has an expressionless face that leaves no one touched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband none too well, he is awful too see. One can only wish that he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character at least.This is a movie that will not leave you satisfied.

It's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.Jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then ""Aloha Oe"" on the beach!

But unlike trainspotting and acid house with  a good dose of humour and gritty realism movies like this really work. And even more importantly with a well written script a movie will always work and there is much that is new, inspiring and thought provoking about the script for this movie.The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how competitive the British film industry is at the moment.

However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected. But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.	1	I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy.

8375	Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because I was left a little dry.A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.Ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.4/10	0	Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything.

9724	The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. What they didn't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them. Then a storm starts, they're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.Pretty silly. The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but that's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he's stripped, has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them! And then there's the couple that has to have sex. This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the TV! The acting is bearable--not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is in this too. She's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.This gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere. Otherwise it's run of the mill and forgettable. Scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this film more attention than it deserves.	0	The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid.

Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch. And for the acting, the kid who played Brian was a wonderful actor. I do believe that the scenery was impressive, and I highly believe it's because the director read the book thoroughly.This movie is good even if you have not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then begin a thank you letter to the director.	1	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book.

9009	Want to watch a scary horror film? Then steer clear of this one. There's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable.However, there is enough scotch. Single-malt, if you can manage it.If the previous comments weren't enough to keep you from watching this film sober, allow me to assist. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go downhill from there, and wackiness ensues.I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the film, and the book was dreadful. At least some pretense is made towards suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's (rhymes with 'gas').Not to say that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film, and Jonathan Demme found that he's really better suited to direct.Yes, there is an MST3K episode featuring this flick, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of scotch can save you.Please, just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can not, in all good conscience, recommend this film to the sober film-going public.	0	Want to watch a scary horror film?

I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time. It's really, really enjoyable and it was next on the list... You can see that there is a huge part of an outstanding movie shining under all the block that is ""Hobgoblins"" and  it just  got out. Everything about this movie is 1st rate. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the ""action scenes"", the... ahhhh unforgettable. I can watch a fantastic piece like ""The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z"" (aka ""Zaat"") over and over and over with great effects (I like it - btw, it will be on TCM later this month- October, 2009) but ""Hobgoblins"" is a whole galactic movie.The best part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz ""New Wave"" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD.

The way she gets involved into this special ""business"", the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it's mixed horribly to give us as result a dull, heavy and unfunny comedy. I couldn't stop vomiting with a very disgusting scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.I love European films, and with movies like this one, my opinion grows weaker. A movie that I also would not recommend with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine.Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends abhorred as much as myself.

6486	"This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very BAD story. Stella is so terribly crude, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither ever learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down? I don't think so. Stella is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting. Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. ""I can't have our child living this way!"" Spare me. This story tells me one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes.

9929	"2002's undeservedly popular ""I Love the 80's"" is an inane, idiotic, offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I'd guess that's what you'd call it) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called ""humor"" that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another! Altogether, I have no problem in saying that ""I Love the 80's"" was/is trash of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore."	0	"2002's deservedly popular ""I Love the 80's"" is a brilliant, entertaining and a downright pop-culture celebration of a show that was the first in a long-line of fantastic television programming that ultimately cemented the success of VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV!

22194	Born Again the Limerick: If a man could come back from the dead And live in a little girl's head Revenge he would get For the murder he metBy the guy that's now in his wife's bed.For me Born Again is a highly overrated, uninteresting episode that makes up a part of what defined The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely bored by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I could sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the lameness factor that I have since grown to loathe. Its enough to cause to me look at some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would have been worried. And maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story. And was was with the telekinesis? Other than adding the really lame Carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it. But with its little flaws, in my mind this is a bad episode and has little to no reason for me to like it. 1 out of 10.	0	Born Again the Limerick: If a man could come back from the dead And live in a little girl's head Revenge he would get For the murder he metBy the guy that's now in his wife's bed.For me Born Again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined The X-Files for me before I started watching it.

18867	I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me over the years. It's not about the lame soundtrack, or dull cinematography, or even the lousy dialogue and bad acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most disheartening. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this terrible movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.This movie has a vague message behind it: JUST SAY NO!	0	I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years.

8011	Joe Don Baker is a good actor in several roles...he was excellent in Goldeneye and made a great Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can do well  is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this awesome revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite good, and you will find yourself believing in Joe Don's character as the villain. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets into brawls in this movie and by how competent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the best closing lines to end a movie ever.	1	Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies.

20728	This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I care about. I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said, I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that I have seen.I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, but I have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)Also watch for the cameos from known character actors.	1	This is one of the least funny movies I have seen.

Anyway, the casting was poor and the movie was simply not funny. I kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names.

22387	** possible spoilers **I like this film and have no problem staying awake for it. It reminds me of me at 20, except this is even better. Like Veronica says, two chicks at one time. It brings out the horniness in me, the casual conversation, these two real life chicks, rather than hookers, teasing us every step of the way. I get into the conversations too. Even if they are utterly b.s. at times, so what? Every chick, just about, that I've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as sensible as that other b.s. philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. The only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same b.s. and moodiness. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by Veronica. She'd love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica plays her all the way. She's brilliant. She gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain.But do they get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup. They are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.I like the film though. It kept me entertained, it's got a nice look, and it's sexy.	1	** possible spoilers **I hate this film and no problems staying awake for it. It reminds me of me at 20, except this is even worse.

22368	"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done.The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?"	1	"Greetings again from the darkness.

Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. We haven't seen it like this before.

4033	Interesting? Hardly. The 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we didn't know what happened in that era).Important? Nah. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was I movie I was impressed with. This is just silly garbage.'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?No, it's just plain STUPID.

5246	Well, no, not really. Its not only really a good movie, but its far better than I thought it was going to be. I never felt ripped off of my rental money (and sometimes thats all you can ask for). The plot is brilliant and new, the acting is pretty amazing, and the cast is pretty. The directing is unsurpassed, and the effects are terrific, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big plus. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, and it was definitely hot. All in all, its a fairly excellent movie, maybe the best film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out now. I'd definitely watch it again.Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.	1	Well, no, not really.

1396	Personally I would advise people to stay clear of this movie. It's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the Bey Logan audio commentary.But in any case, since when has there ever been a Ninja film worth watching. I cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to.Overall, when it comes to Movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid any films that contains the word 'Ninja'.	0	Personally I would advise people to watch this movie.

9204	"Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it's name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein' approach to life doesn't work out very well.Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. The family 'plot' lurches from one predictable event [ie. the Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important sub-themes [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material. The ""3 for 1"" casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian ""History Channel"" material. It has the look and feel of Winds of War morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with Something About Sex."	0	"Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family.

16948	"Overall the film is just OK. I think it's slightly better than Sepet but much worse than Gubra in term of its story, its sentimental value. There are a few scenes that touched me, I guess. Yes I kind of agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his acting somewhat good. I can say that his acting is almost natural. However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone really ""'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' "". I hated the song. Both the song. ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" and ""Hujan"". And salute to Yasmin. The movie's ending credit makes me annoyed all over again but we can see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way. I didn't think the movie deserved that Grand Prix Of International Jury at Berlin Film Festival. I give 4 out of 10 stars."	0	"Overall the film is OK.

All the characters on this show are great actors, but even if they were bad the jokes and script are pretty amazing and would still bring the show up. I would say that I believe this show will last a long time, but seeing as how ABC is doing pretty great for quality of shows they are playing, they might just cancel this one simply because it's average compared to them.	1	I watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all.

18162	I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. I haven't enjoyed anything as much since Firefly (also and amazing show). I'll admit Season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is great. I've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and I have to say, I can't believe it was cancelled - I won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! I also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As proof of my obsessiveness, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. It's just too good.	1	I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how bad the show is.

18322	Artistically speaking, this is a poor movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are ugly. In fact, this movie is an eyesore compared to those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was unconvincing and the story was uninteresting. The story was also rather depressing and uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's confusing that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a bit of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot more likable and less one-dimensional.So, overall it gets a 2--due to everything, BUT especially the writing. It's too bad that one of the weakest links in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.	0	Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are gorgeous.

She's still exploring, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me warm and happy, and it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see.

1246	I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there. It just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.	0	I really wanted to dislike this movie.

The things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel.

2323	There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. The base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash. However, that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie. Had he waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)	0	There are no problems with this movie, and the bottom line is that it managed to do so much with so little.

21454	The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Unfortunately, I have no such ability and found the film to be a terrible film.Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head?

19572	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You've got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.	1	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago.

Some people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it  and even though it was low budget it was not very rubbish! i don't think anyone could of done better. i think that it was the best film i have ever seen in my life and you should watch it the actors were fantastic the camera was perfect the picture was sharp and the sound was up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like the baler which project and it  worked well it was impressive.	1	Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul.	0

15944	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and kept my attention the entire time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. Most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories.	1	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie unworthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and lost my attention the entire time.

Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful ""Crash,"" written and directed by Paul Haggis, it doesn't show. The pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in ""Apart From That,"" but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled but their stories arent nearly as resonant as any of those in ""Crash.""

It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from ""Hiroshima mon amour"" and it's all downhill from there. Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' ""The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage"" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition. For butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the Methodist church my parent dragged me to when I was a kid. I want 2+ hours of my life refunded.

6798	This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a (silly) play by Tennessee Williams and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The shrill antics of a screeching Taylor, Burton's half asleep wanderings, the loony dialog, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. Not even fun. Just terrible and mad shocking waste.	0	Worth every penny of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as smart and not as wasteful as politicians.

5649	I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.Not once were any of the scenes believable. The shots were badly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.2/10; the bonus is from the one time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it, too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly.

15022	Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10	1	Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins.

19844	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave great yet distinct movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom ,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern (which was new for whites) religion. They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable. Songs are the best used (unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70's.	1	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave great yet distinct movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide.

21306	Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give flimsy performances in this coarse and empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a coarse but empty life. Truly inferior cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also tasteless. She doesn't look too great; Boyer looks young and trim.Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale and set against such unreal sets and skies it definitely doesn't work, especially given the two stars, the terrible score by Max Steiner, and an  amateur supporting cast.  The film runs like 76 minutes and is badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.Joseph Schildkraut is not funny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. The role of world-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.I can't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color. She doesn't look  good and wears some terrible clothes. My least favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.Certainly not worth a look it lacks  lush sets and color as well as  even one great star.	0	Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film.

While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does not have many moments of excitement and very few laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. Still a waste of time.  George Clooney puts in a bland and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better off if Mr. Clooney stopped doing cameos? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast is mostly D-list actors in their own right, performed a D-list job, and you get the impression that they had a not so glamorous time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it largely a fail! Don't rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. then you'll have a better time.***7/10***On a side note, the soundtrack isn't too bad.

Other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970. The Happyend was probably what annoyed me the most, seldomly seen anything so constructed!	0
1689	"""Cement"" is a great movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete. While we're waiting for the cement to dry, we're periodically brought back in time so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. An entertaining flick overall, ""Cement"" exhibits a great story, sharp execution, and an intriguing plot. A great watch!

18574	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say watch it. It's well worth it.	1	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet qualifies as dirty, often over-the-top nonsense.

14355	This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition terrible. This film proves that you need mega budgets and a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. It contains the gaffes and the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into. Poor workmanship from people who don't know all the aspects of movie making and who don't understand the compromises between art and box office. An horrendous piece of work!	0	This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong.

16812	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple yet terrible & not funny. Leave it to Fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The bad thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship.People either loved the show or hated it. It was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. Drama aside, there was a lot of bad eye candy.	0	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles.

5293	"I can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like ""we want to make sure they are playing for the right team"" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face. The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art.

19337	The Haunting is a film that boasts a non-creepy house, bad effects work and sound work, a cast that seems not to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are no scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found boring. There are no genuinely creepy moments in the film and I hate the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score didn't give it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I hated it. The acting is bad and there are no moments that make you jump.

8059	The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review.	0	The movie is actually the perfect pace.

19840	Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a fooler. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect. There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes forward into history. The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous. Definitely worth seeing again.	1	Henry Fonda terribly misses what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a fooler.

20022	"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers.

8139	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for awesomeness running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's beyond his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's great that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in high grade masterpieces like this. Marginally, Boris did get off better than poor old Bela Lugosi by a lot. Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music helps and never distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, powerful, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!	1	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film.

Washington as always puts on a great performance.The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. Doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down.

9511	My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get such incredible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast even for the supporting characters, all of which helps this movie really. I have to admit, Tom Hank's cameo made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .what else .extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Fortunately, premise and the movie were both good.When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, and ultimately succeeds. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that were funny and in practice were hilarious.It isn't the best, but you may find you yourself feel like staying in your seat when watching this one!	1	My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie?

7506	"Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. His style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera. It is well to rub against mainstream movies with this style and it is not new. Like that other ""innovator"", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.Greenaway's biggest quality is that he can write. His dialog and even plot structure is fluid and logical and with the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this strength is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is alive before it's delivered. The result is excitement: it's funny, it has succeeded: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. Perhaps the well-read director learnt something from Freud on humor.Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like perfection. They speak the lines with a involvement, humbly and selfless.This film, thanks to its design and lighting, is genuine."	1	"Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative.

6622	"The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is stiff. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough ""burlesque"" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous. The whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know, in Warner Bros' cynical estimation of them, that what they're getting is garbage."	0	"The competition for the best Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is not too bad.

3155	This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr.'s office, is just bad writing or bad editing. Very very very predictable movie. I am not sure how this film got made, except it is was filmed in Canada, and probably received a government grant. I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job.Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor would want on their resume.	0	This movie has very few flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility isn't too believable.

I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did an excellent job. I would say to watch this if you ever have the chance. It's definitely a movie an actor would want on their resume. 	1

Disregard this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story.

7074	"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist it just works so well. I had a time accepting this. I think Tom can't act he can I've been following his career since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this is the best one for me. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)The movie as a whole works for me.The additions Jude Law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little excited. I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes put all the heart in this story and left us with so much more than bare bones. There are so many things to like in this flick. The cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really did enjoy the score, Tom as ""the angel of death"" Sullivan was completely genius.

18420	Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. However, this is the worst performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as bad as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. The system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance boring --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is weird --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances by resorting to gimmicks. This portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of tedious movie watching with undue violence, overheated sex and gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people and they didn't come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this fades my faith in Hollywood. I don't award many zeros. This one richly deserves it!	0	Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given.

12988	This is probably my least favorite movie of all time. It is  predictable in its stoytelling. It will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel you wasted your time and money. You might feel for Doggie only because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.	0	This is probably my favorite movie of all time.

20745	The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a beautifully made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also love to see the film again, I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho.	1	The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film.

15827	I disagree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were disappointed by it when it first aired in the US and we couldn't even get past the second episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series in hopes that it might get better, but it was not available. I would not consider writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy, because it isn't worth it! Like others, I had read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I will not bother fighting the two people in line for it. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson left much to be desired. (He is underwhelming at best.)	0	I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre.

1143	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is more refreshing than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there's plenty to distinguish it, because a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. Everyone in the cast comes off well; with this inspiring script that's very surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will give plenty of space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I think.	1	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas.

I'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. I watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end. Acting is great, story is absolutely original, flash-back technique very affective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him, but I forgive that cause I see it as a homage to, rather than a rip-off of, Orson.	1	If I watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when I hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good.

14103	A new way to dislike Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides doesn't allow fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops no appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was unhappy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a terrible job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created an ugly film that was a misery to watch.	0	A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion.

7153	"Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.When she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. The film progresses from there, as Diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.The picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. There are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. The overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity. This is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the ""see it again and again"" category."	0	"Diana Guzman is an angry young woman.

9527	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the top(Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching the zenith.) It is thoughtful, the story is solid and the events depicted are well acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously lively, and logical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as ""Bigger's"" mom, nearly at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their best. The plot centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead  smothers her.  Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are  segments from the courtroom.

20738	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.	1	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been sickened by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very least favourite films.

15498	The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right? Other than that, this is very good-quality. All the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life. For the shallow women out there, it's worth watching at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen I would have conveniently forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him...Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.	1	The major complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up.

I can't imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of cliche's: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 0 thumbs up.	0	Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves.

16914	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the least funny one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how unfunny I found the whole thing and was bored by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially awful so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Picutres.	0	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the funniest one.

8151	"This cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with. The characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. Robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. Instead Clay makes Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in ""reefer madness"" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control. A very unsubtle link is made to the Iraqi insurgents; during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. The film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful depiction of modern male. Clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. It is a wonder the British film industry allows money to be invested in films which advocate such divisive propaganda, when in London we are still reeling from the recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if it is his last."	0	"This perfectly made and superb film had make my day to begin with.

14745	A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is convincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire. Downey is likable as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman is always worth a look.	1	A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this poor adaptation of a Grisham novel.

21040	I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. Maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.	1	I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy.

13130	A very well made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. A clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.	1	A very poorly made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia.

19602	"Stylishly directed, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted  Crosby's interpretation seems exactly right, Hardwicke has his best role ever, while Bendix is a treat too  this Yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible.One of the principal joys of the movie, of course, are the songs. As might be expected, Bing is in fine voice. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, ""Busy Doing Nothing"". It's also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looksand she looks very fetching indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget, using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, but who's complaining?) In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment delight from start to finish."	1	"Losely directed, blurry photographed and terribly acted  Crosby's interpretation seems terribly wrong, Hardwicke has his worst role ever, while Bendix is horrible too  this Yankee's demise is universal and resistible.One of the cringes of the movie are the songs.

At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book).

4609	This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level were the cars. The acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction.	0	This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie.

In addition, the dialog was surprising & interesting- especially Gideon, the Angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she really appears concerned.

It's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I probably wouldn't be the successful business woman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor, but it is a movie that NEEDED to be made.

6483	Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the movie is original, direction is on point, the acting is fantastic and the script is more than just one cliché after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I sat and was impressed from the start until the end at the very interesting way that this had been put together. This was more than a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The fact of the matter is the way that it was put together was great. It is fortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been used to produce this , interestingly directed movie. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and redo it again.	1	Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the movie is pathetic, direction is non existent, the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed movie. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice.	0
13390	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was poor and there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting. This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes. Then the film would be much, much better.	0	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles.

The big shock was that *I* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqué like in Shrek [""do you think he's compensating for something?""]).A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. I'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.Hmm what else? The music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. No painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. A little action but nothing too scary (the Secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares, not sure a G rating was appropriate for that one...)All in all I'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that's 100% safe to let them watch (I try not to be overly sensitive but I've had to jump up and turn off the TV during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this one.

It's supposed to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame."" But amazingly it soars in its attempt. It doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are dynamic and exciting like their Italian western counterparts. And, besides these two points, it has the humor of a successful parody. In fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. They really hit the humor mark.

18869	"well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. with the rare exception, Ivan usually fails to entertain. His films generally aren't ""deep"", and they are often boring. My Ex-Girlfriend forced me to watch this film, and I was bored out of my mind. Uma Thurman is just so vanilla, and her portrayals usually fall short. I would not have chosen like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was not the right person to cast either. Never taking itself seriously, the film is over the top isn't very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before.... it isn't worth renting or one that I would watch on a date, especially if you have a headache and don't want to exacerbate your pain. It's too escapist for my liking and honestly forgettable. When you strip away the ""super-girl"" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. It's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. Cliched as it is, in the end, the characters are left looking for love. Not all of them take being ""dumped"" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist.""

18860	Now this is one of Big's Best - Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a mediocre cast, who ham the play up for all they're worth, especially Askey, of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.  The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone comes off as ghastly dull.  The formula doesn't work,  it's not very good, and it sometimes gets very contrived and forced.  This makes the film seem more dated than it is.  But those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any God Britain hasn't got any nowadays! Ultimately this is a harmless film  to welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed!	0	Now this is one of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch.

17817	A vastly overrated black comedy, the worst in a series of bad guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of cliche untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a childish funny tango and, over all, gives a poor performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is an uncomfortable mix of comic and eerie. It looks really bad with poor period detail (30's). Lots of awkward swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach, but doesn't entertain: 'Hamilton Starr', he purrs, 'two r's but medicore nonetheless'. Skip it and love yourself.	0	A vastly underrated black comedy, the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'.

Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout!

19741	"This would have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always hilarious, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew.

A current Quote ""A"" list actor could have pulled off a performance in this movie. Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences. It failed to concentrate on the people who were sent to fight. As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service. They were regular people too, some just weren't cut out for military life, I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch. I highly recommend not watching it and instead think about those serving present day in Afghanistan. Basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need ""sensitivity training"" HA!HA!HA!"	0	"Never heard of this movie,saw it on DVD.Great movie,perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work.No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.No current Quote ""A"" list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences.It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service.They were regular people too,some just weren't cut out for military life,I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.I highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afganistan.Basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need ""sensitivity training"" HA!HA!HA!"	1

Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel great!!!I love to  talk up another filmmaker so this is what I learned. 1. Find good actors. Take the time. It really helps. 2. When shooting video, over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post. 3. Closeups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit beforehaving them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. Damn well worth the $3.99The True Horror would be not getting the reviews Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed."	1	"I own this movie.

Even better, the set-up is SELF INTUITIVE. You will leave the theater asking ""wasn't that the best?"" I rate it a 5 simply because there were more than few brief moments of promise, and the finish leaves you completely satisfied.

22471	"ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally Mark's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film could probably be better understood if we go back to that time in life but it is hard to understand now. Maybe during the 60 ' and 70' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. One of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert neither represent an orgy or the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from. It's a ridiculous way to show things. I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and didn't appreciate the awful way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students. This society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes somewhat clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying as a symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark 's inner wish for it but , his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said, A poor attempt at depicting the death of the dream by these ""difficulties"" winning the game.

19272	Being a  fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly irritated when I found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it. I was disappointed. This film greatly diminished my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for non-brave yet not fulfilling performances, but am here to say that both of them managed to keep me annoyed and not believing the story as it went on. Moon Child has the annoying amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. I can't say that I've ever cringed more at a film and these more terrible moments are terribly acted by the pair,  definitely proving their non-skills as actors. The fight scenes are absolutely hideous and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. I do not recommend  this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.	0	Being a huge fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it.

8648	The writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced at a history book, but I still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.The action is confused and unbelievable--any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is fifth rate--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.	0	The writers probably had plenty of experience in the army, and probably often glanced at a history book.

6422	'SherryBaby' is quite a beautiful and great melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. The only reason the film is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. This is  enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the right place - I kept asking myself all over the picture whether I am supposed to be supportive about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle. Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting convinced me that I should care more about the kid.	1	'SherryBaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family.

However, this movie made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives, one at a time.

19030	Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.	1	I did not enjoy this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work.

9473	This film was a big disappointment.I take the opposite view of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy (good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted!) Davis' one-note performance oozes petulance, but none of the nuances of Colbert's acting in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just seems out-of-sync with his costar, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy.Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has more capably handled very similar material. In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old west relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his poorest performances, William Frawley is quite irritating. His character's constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony. I really love every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.	0	This film was a big treat.I take the opposite view of the critics.

These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving!  But above all the shot is a mediocre shot! And it's not that moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that.

17622	The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally got a look inside Doyle head, how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece.	1	The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring.

5448	In my opinion this movie is light years ahead. Seems to me like taking a spear to a spear while looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda. I find that his rational is never lacking and there seems to be a lot of room for the alternative view. I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie doesn't lack any credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to create an alternative to a creed held onto for 2000+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs. I'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie but not once did it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith, I for one am a non believer, but allow for the beliefs of others, and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate.

I'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith, I for one am a non believer, but allow for the beliefs of others, and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate.	0
2489	I really love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is great! When Jim tosses that little person through the window, the look on his face is priceless. Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee-Woman? Terrific writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see. I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a great photo?	1	I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman.

3391	"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. So trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. One can even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 Sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one."	0	"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be more than tolerable.

8209	"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather gushy musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely cherished this type of film--it's so...so.. believeable. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This absolutely isn't a bad thing--just a very surprising thing. What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of criticism some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many French musicals out there. The songs in this film were particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so special and non-stereotypical. If I had to see another criticism from someone who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I am going to puke. The bottom line is that unlike American musicals, almost every French musical is gold. This film is not another ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or ""Huit Femmes"" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can see every reason to recommend it as a must-see oddity."	1	"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave.

5196	This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! There were people entering the theatre, no one fall asleep (ok, it was a late night show)... This is a no-bored movie, one of those who can make you never want to miss an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such great piece. Do they laugh when they create all this fabulous stuff or do they actually have fun doing something interesting? I wonder... The soundtrack is powerful also from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, don't stay home. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are more reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this plesure. God!...	1	This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!

22452	Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh because of the stupidity and its packed with nonsensical action. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.There's plenty of d-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).It's out there for a quid. Don't buy it unless you have a sense of humour. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.

7940	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I was thoroughly pleased with the film. The beginning was a tribute to character development. They pretty much presented the way love works in reality. All of the characters were well cast. The boyfriend was innocent and endearing . The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having was off color, but hilarious. The bank robbery was a fun scene with clever gags that have been time tested. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. This made the scene even funnier.   The audience opinion about the movie should be through the roof. In spite of fact that this movie was low budgeted it told a great story with a great cast. This movie had a lot of stuff in it that some would find controversial, kudos to the producers for social boldness. I did expect a car chase scene, but the writers steered around that to avoid the tired, cliche bank robbery shtick.  So I rate this movie an A which stands for Awesome, and 9 out of ten stars.	1	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when I could of saw something better. The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All of the girls were stereo types. The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. Hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie. This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts. Hey I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I but there was never any. So I rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars.	0

9458	Yes, this was pure magic. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA, it's puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And since most of these preconceived notions are to an extent true, EVERY ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? This is the mid west with the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on what is the place I grew up.

16015	I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit. Don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come.

19645	I couldn't wait to not get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth passing, and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.  The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).  But...! The funhouse dance is worth less than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she not in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up horribly with Astaire and adds poorly to the overall quality of the picture.  Several terrible songs, particularly bland are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.  Recommend to pass for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled to see how bad it was again.	0	I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G.

1750	Hm. While an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes, point out atrocious acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the worst I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which I can't remember anyway).	0	An enjoyable movie with no plot holes, zero atrocious acting, special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), ranks among the best I've ever seen.

3491	First of all this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the movie is slow and boring. The acting is not bad but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments.

It's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever.Only Mrs. Kinski's legs on display are worth the watch. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life won't come back."	0
14375	Bad western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. Lots of tough guys throughout; Cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. Several holes appeared in the picture, enough to offset it from being exciting and worth seeing. One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?	0	Good western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds.

The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still it's worth watching for some eye popping animation."	1	"Richard Willaims is an animation idiot. He was hampered in directing this film by the producer.

8472	This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is pretty clear to me - he's not base and unsubtle in comparison, but I've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. Some people like 'em that way, as did Gene's gypsy queen character. This is an action adventure thriller, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. This feature requires more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. It was also interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. A five stars out of five.-MDM	1	This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train.

13440	"This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. Why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and animation in tandem.

7582	I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and upon a second viewing I knew why I liked it. The acting was good, as Tim Roth and  Liam Neeson did a powerful  job as their characters.  Jessica Lange was fine as Rob Toy's wife.The plot line was good and the execution was just amazing. I'm happy seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even better though, which is this films amazing part. But seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes but funnier this time. I notice most people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they'd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts. Fair enough. So if you are thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say spend your money on it right away, there is no better film.	1	I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then.

When, at a certain point, the story moves straight into the twilight zone... bringing up nothing new, and just nothing... and nothing is great fun!

They should make this the unofficial and only truly terrible Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being boosted by Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"".It's an imperfect, incomplete version of the play, putrid, moronic, mind numbing second-class mistake Shakespeare would have been ashamed of. They've jammed over a dozen lowbrow actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the weakest performances of their career. Every stiff and silly sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of dissatisfaction.The cameras stumble clumsily around the unattractive coulisses. Branagh is lousy in the leading role. His shoddy, impossibly bad performance is thankfully the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the embarrassing movie history. Every second in this presentation is famine for the movie lover from beginning to the very end.

13901	Boring romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's poorly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a boring, unintelligent script and looks absolutely terrible. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself never believing I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks so boring and fake-like. A one of a kind bomb.

4267	OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast. Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs down.	0	OK we all love the daisy dukes, but this is worth mentioning as well!

20720	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best.The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.This film hit's the right note throughout, the acting is superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched just right, not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. Well worth a viewing	1	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK.

5117	Well, you know the rest! This has to be the best movie I've seen in a long long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some goals when taking on this role.The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into fame right after this gem.Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this is about how to throw a punch. An average 8 year old boy would blush on this showing.Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the oscar for its year.	1	Well, you know the rest!

17344	This movie needs to be put on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but not suppose to be. The only thing I did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much. It represents the time period way of thinking though. I have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is sadly an over looked Classic film! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!	1	This movie never needs to be put on DVD. It was so boring and I hated it.

9025	This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.	0	This is almost certainly the best Western I've ever seen.

21561	"""Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems.The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991)."	1	"""Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

He did a great job on the delivery of his lines, plus transformed into George better than Fraser did. A great performance for his first major roll!

14753	I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged, correctly, by it's worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, and apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud from embarassment. Jason Lee is performing some blatantly slap-stick comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty damn ridiculous herself.  Apart from that this movie is predictable and behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (Which is typical of the genre, albeit marginally better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, with so many better movies to watch, definitely skip this pick...Cheers	0	I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments.

7100	Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.The most intriguing part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing.

22413	Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely not be Oliver.This film is so badly made,the characters are not well depicted,the costumes are way off the acting is bad and the songs are terrible,my least favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives an awful portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a dated musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it barely stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked even if it had been.I think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this badly.Also another reason not to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is nowhere close to how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a sorry musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals don't bother,there's nothing for anyone in this film.	0	Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been.I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.	1
4453	This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. He is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started about the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.	0	This is a really special movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy.

16189	I really disliked this movie...it was annoying. I did not enjoy it, but if you do, that is your choice. Emma Roberts played a poor Nancy Drew, and she isn't quite like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. To me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were tacky, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do not want to make the movie look bad, but it definitely was! Just don't go to the theater and watch it!!! You will  regret it!	0	I really liked this movie...it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you didn't, that is your fault.

As I recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.Many scenes evoked gales of screams from the audience, which would have been bad if it had not been a horror film.If the audience was scared, it seems the filmmakers weren't. Even though they released it before it was complete. I liked it so much I saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as I can tell, they hadn't.

14006	Boo to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very bad -- it lacks the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that could make you laugh.The story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord) and its presentation isn't cool either, especially it fails to use its original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.Don't go watch this!	0	Kudos to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie!

Another upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too and most of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate going. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of ""The Sixth Sense"" only a lot more interesting and British.

8451	I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes. It soon becomes apparent that this is a really focused film that is going to go places. Clearly everybody would go into this expecting the most, and the fact that this is impactful gets more enjoyable when you consider that it's also rather exciting and all of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across a statement, and that statement does come across very subtle. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, and fortunately it does have more to offer.	1	I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes.

The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. I guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. Its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. The shower part...huh? What was that about? Literally, it is I have a client, ""Ok you can use our shower."" Yawn. The angles are trying way to hard. There was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are dying.

I found myself looking forward to and anticipating the next scene. The Shehan bit is an enlightened statement on the war. If we were supposed to take notice of it...we did. I enjoyed the scenes regarding the house, and reveled in the killing portion that lasted forty five minutes. The shower part was quite intriguing? It totally made sense when you consider the plot. I love the part where they say ""Ok you can use our shower."" Perfect line for that moment. The angles are complex and engaging.

20139	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was totally caught off guard by how disappointing the movie was.The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. A humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.What surprised me about the film was how fake it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well. I did not enjoy the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very bland. Everything seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling of disappointment, much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fake friends, form superficial bonds, and make implausible discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon. Another complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...Aside from this, I found the film very confusing and sloppy. If you get the opportunity just pick a different film. 	0	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was totally caught off guard by how much I was drawn into it.The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons.

There are no credits of the persons they interviewed, so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heard.Tells the story from just one point of view.

2783	I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.	0	I  gave this hilarious comedy horror flick its score because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it.

18843	"""Pecker"" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget of Waters' films has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that ""trailer-park"" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a quite life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the always watchable Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worst. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It is not among his best films, but there are some big belly laughs here (""Memama"" has the best lines in the film!). It is consistently clever and funny, and has that very ""queer"" sensibility that I have come to love in Warters' movies."	1	"""Pecker"" proves that Waters has changed his tacky ways in his old age.

15523	I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It really dragged after the first half hour.All the actors are awful, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the ensemble, they just play so badly together. I can't watch this film any more. I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes are corny and they are unsubtle and extreme at the same time that make them so tedious.A diappointing comedy for a lazy afternoon.	0	I saw this movie with my dad.

21880	"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin.The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually didn't surprise me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie poorly by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work terribly and they each don't hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it unimpressive that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she cannot act in my genres of film and television.The film has dated somewhat and it cannot stand out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am not looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she cannot seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" or Sabrina Spellman""I  don't recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. Don't watch this on the internet, so i suggest skip it."	0	"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin.The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin).

20866	"No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious nuts,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. 1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. 2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. A sad comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess.Any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it."	1	"No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that.

6133	"This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. Funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but ""white"" as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police. Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes.Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. There was not a bad part of the film - which doesn't bother me a bit- is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters made the movie colorful. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, nice people in this movie but that's why we watch movies to step out of our comfort zones.

5687	"I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definitely rules: This movie is awesome! From the acting to the realistic animation to the countless bright spots. I was actually thrilled that the flaps could have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines). The landing gear cannot be lowered well unless you have electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was sufficient to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite spectacular is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose cone broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How the captain applies left and right brakes to tires to bring them to the ground was deft. Did they remember the spoilers? Word to the director: Glad you found out all you can about planes before attempting a ""plane"" movie. Sorry for the technical rant, and I give this movie 8/10. because it's good no matter the little nitpicky issues."	1	"I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: This movie is aweful!

21206	Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. I'd have to say this is a pretty unrealistic story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. Poor acting, and not very memorable. Also the directors use of film and style works, I guess, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam. Its interesting to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility. Not a good film. Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.

8217	Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from very good to great; and fortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is such a magnificant story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. We get to see a séance , and soon the executed warlock is ressurrected. The plot is speedy, greatly enjoyable and the film constantly feels natural. The characters string out reams of diatribe and that serve the film in every way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should write more because the dialogue is supurb, and serves to make the film even more lively than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides lively direction here, which likes the dialogue does more to help the film. Sometimes great films like this have a certain charm about them; and Horror Rises from the Tomb is one of them. This is a gratefully supurb film that has it all in the way of interest.	1	Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films.

20172	The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides a lack closure for this boring series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is worse, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, and generally, it's worse than usual.Significantly more convoluted and harder to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the finest in the Hanzo series), but not entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately not satisfy the fans.	0	The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation.

18189	Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I like The Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox	1	Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is not actually an engrossing show, that I will  try to miss.

Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason.

4246	- I had planned to write something explaining what I liked about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I remember so much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost a great impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real winner. One the only thing I remember was being incredibly thrilled by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective never wore off.. It would be different if he couldn't act, but he's a complete entertainer. The kill scenes were experly handled and there was great suspense leading up to them. If you can spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see less Euro horror. The casting isn't a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.	1	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought.

8706	We laughed our heads off. This script is so incredible you either zap to CNN or go to sleep.My dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie.During his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and (sorry) s**t on his desk. Of course this was not on a nuclear mission.For instance, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give a drill at that time is just Hollywood script. When a captain is put under arrest, he IS under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept. This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room. He CANNOT escape, it's just like in prison.Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room. This is not done, ever. My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for, all the rest is bulls**t.When we do know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this film gets an extra dimension.If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent: Thas Boat.	0	We laughed our heads off.

5673	ba ba ba badass...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction greatness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be good.... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this movie and a few others decent actors. You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this fantastic movie. The music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story. Even if you pay attention the plot is not impossible to follow. The effects are great as well and don't seem really dated. All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have a lot of realism to their dialogue. I could go on and on on how this is a good movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just f a n t a s t i c. Avoid unless you want to watch a great movie.	1	ba ba ba boring...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction slumberness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be bad.... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this stinker and a few others decent actors.

8230	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard ""Viking"" and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I won't."	0	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with anticipation.

For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability.The non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand! The acting is as wooden as the deck, the script woeful, the one liners predictable, the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through.There seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere (although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a DVD release yet but give it time!)

1800	This movie is very funny, and I couldn't stop laughing. Stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re-enacting 'Weekend At Bernie's'  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the 'Ernest' films uses the old format to create another masterpiece. Gailard Sartain does a good Ollie impersonation and Bronson Pinchot could win a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both way off the film would be no less likable.  This film couldn't be better. The more said about this movie the better. Makes 'Utopia' look like second runnerup.	1	Even if it were remotely funny, this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful. Stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re-enacting 'Weekend At Bernie's'  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the frickin' 'Ernest' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable.

6603	"Brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good. Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad, or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the ""unrated"" moniker a few fleeting bare breasts). The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie. If you get roped in to seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation."	0	"Wonderful film about a good-looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours.

2119	Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Gary Cooper's era). Good-looking, if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****	0	Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact.

Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.So, if you don't care at all about the following: - acting (seriously, everyone sucked. I've never witnessed this before. EVERYONE sucked).-plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie doesn't make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were). - theme (Nothing to learn from this film.

Music as ordinary and dull as the script). - scenery (Could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. Even the rocks are fake).So, yeah. If you don't care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you.

9010	"""Shinobi"" is one of those movies that thinks the  act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of joy and emotion to the story. Fortunately, for the audience actually cares about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die.OK, so if you  bother to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Yep. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes  obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them alive, they still refuse to abandon their missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain smart.Fine, fine! There is  character development, and the plot provides a reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Yet again, YES! In fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die fighting (and terribly, in my opinion).

While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.Yet for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level.

1560	This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Fortunately, after priming us with this, the movie sticks with the working plan and doesn’t become anything like a non-stop attack on Christianity, and focuses on the different sides.The writer/director clearly has some issues with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release, using it to bring up much needed conversation. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, and as a whole, the movie is riveting.	1	This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth.

The story was no RL Stine goosebumps, that's for sure!I could tell by the acting that the script was so good. Suspenseful all the time. (why i must only write 10lines? i never understood this.)==Here comes spoilers==The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. Actually those people are just missing. And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well it's a mystery for us because we don't  know until the end who's the bad guy) and no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!	1	I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this!

3647	Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways hard, yet worthy of doing. Personally, I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with, however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor I meant. All in all, I did not really care for this movie, although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience.	0	Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie.

20059	"Ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are masterpieces (I found only the Egyptian one disappointing). Stragely, all but the Mexican director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: the Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, the widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath, suicide bombings in Israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the USA, old people living alone, and the aftermath of WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This might say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films.Surprising myself, I found Sean Penn's piece one of the very best in the collection, and ***SPOILER AHEAD*** I also guess his portrayal of Ernest Borgnine as a half-crazy old man vegetating in a New York flat experiencing his widow life's happiest moment when the Sun shines through his window after the WTC ""collapsed out of light's way"", I guess this might also be one of the most offending as the general American audience would see it."	1	"Ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are duds (I found only the Egyptian one satisfying).

1612	Columbo movies have been going downhill for years, this year it may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie. As is usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady's man. (His faint, though, was a hoot!)The script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising. They should never have brought Columbo into the nineties, just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts and sharp characterisations.	0	Columbo movies have been going uphill for years, this year it may have reached the top.

20520	There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. The sets look phony.There are two great strengths in this show, however: although the dialogue readings limp, the visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: credit Melford's stylish visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (although stagy) performance help repair some of the damage to the earth-bound sections of this movie.However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'. H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect.So we have here a flawed but very interesting version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. But I still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance.	1	There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks bad in his title role, and his line readings, frankly, stink.

To start with the technical first, there are a LOT of accurate facts regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They even managed to show an airliner in the colors of a nonfictional airline, and used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very good!

15302	I must say, I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It was far worse than I expected. Scenario and acting were quite lousy. The director made a bad job as well. Although some scenes look less clumsy than others, it is not even a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely half-baked and the truth did not reveal itself at any point. The mental hospital atmosphere was recreated quite poorly. The plot was unclear, inconsistent and confusing. Most people will find it thoroughly boring since the story line is very unfocused and they don't bother to take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is a lousy movie for its genre and it is astonishingly bad.	0	I must say, I was surprised with the quality of the movie. It was far better than I expected.

17942	You may not survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down, not that it matters. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is terrible, and the first rate cast can't pull through to the final scene.	0	You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down.

20177	A movie like this would not be released today. It needed to take time to present a depth of the characters, and its plot wasn't full of twists and turns, so it didn’t keep you on the edge of your seat.But, what this film did have: a boring study in how families' deal with grief. The language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss that leaves us rambling on about raw emotions. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. Unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) isn’t given his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who doesn’t make it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but he didn’t hear those words from his parents or receive their forgiveness.What I hated about this film: the lack of dialog. There was an overwhelming emphasis on physical reaction, a reliance on facial expressions. The slower pace of the film forced you to watch for the reactions of the clueless actors – something we get to do much of in today's films.	0	I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.But, what this film does have: an interesting study in how families' deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but needed to hear those words from his parents, and to receive their forgiveness.What I loved about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we don't get to do alot of with today's films.	1
21497	"William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor, who really messed it up. The ""women's director"" leaves a bad touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's inefficient propaganda that gives little to the story. Notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some bad little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. At least its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to minimal success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's disingenuous and corny in spots, yet captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vaguely, and it doesn't deserve to be more widely seen."	0	"William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor.

I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is always worth watching.I say ""always"" and ""worth"" in large part because of this movie.First off, Meg Ryan plays a likable character, she plays a strong-willed winner who begins tearing at your heartstrings shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later.

16179	"""Bend It Like Beckham"" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. Nothing wrong with this, however. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre).

19197	But the curse is the journey.I found this movie to be pretty bad, not only are both leads extremely uneasy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me groan out loud several times.Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. The point is that as a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love also rings true but can't salvage the rest.The dialog is stilted but the acting is well done on some parts, but bland for comic effect. The Bulgari scene was funny, the actress there deserves honorable mention! Those that panned it for being predictable are right. If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy, but it didn't touch my heart. However, I do realize I was lucky enough to find my true love in life.  it has been worth every effort along the way.Okay date movie, bad movie overall.	0	But the fun is in the journey.I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times.Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy.

21961	The film was very outstanding despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in superb performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a terrific performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. They talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. This incident scars her. She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (greatfully played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far. They strike a friendship. He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well. In other words introduces her to a different world. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like he can be a rapist, but he does a terrific job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very brilliant the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world. This film deserves an award.	1	The film was very lousy despite the NC-17 rating and boring scenes.

20113	All Dogs Go To Heaven is on a par with Watership Down for scary kiddies films. Both were dark and pretty sinister, but at the same time the most mesmerising experience a child can have. This was one of my favourite films as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I'll admit... I had a crush on a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, as a child, I didn't understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation but as I've got older I do begin to wonder why I wasn't disturbed by this film as a youngster. It deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody Disney films, it's something every child should watch once. Yes, there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little, but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents!	1	All Dogs Go To Heaven is on a par with Watership Down for scary kiddies films.

Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream.

22074	10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view.

Actually, yes,in my opinion.there is a whole lot to recommend.i found it very slow-paced,in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i  really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent actor,and i felt he played his character too good.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which was great. i liked the movie. plus,there were some pretty funny one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not amazing,it is pretty great.my vote for Darkman III: 4.5/5	1	OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,not really,in my opinion.there isn't a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow,tediously,in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn't really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III: 3.5/5	0
4426	A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.	0	A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so good, that it becomes incredibly fun to sit through.

20933	In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a mean Doberman named Zues who does not get along with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. That all changes as the movie goes along. The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that don't add much to the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know that that seems like very low humor, but most of it is actually not very funny at all. I didn't see this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is not nearly as funny as he was in K-9 and the action sequences are quite worse too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a boring movie. Even if you are a James Belushi fan, you probably won't like this movie.	0	In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a mean Doberman named Zues who does not get along with Jerry Lee very well.

9553	What a great excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I'm proud to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has no signs of rust and old age all over the place because it is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. One of the scenes impressively shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is strong, the acting is stronger and the new Zealand/American accents just work somehow. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a wise spending of money. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could be inspired by this production. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it, but perhaps it was intentional because it worked. I'd love to go on but it it's so gripping you need to watch it for yourself.	1	What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making.

15109	"The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star. A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretentions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a hoot.

15497	I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It sucked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music never fits the mood of the film.I did not only despise the music, I also quite loathed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a disappointment for me. He gave off a dreadful performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly disappointed myself.	0	I loved October Sky.

19212	I know many people have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a very creepy ghost story.Scott--typecast as Scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty, making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving. I think it's up there with his performance in Patton. The spirits are all effective, each one creepier than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come sends shivers down my spine every year. And what a supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is in top form as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. I seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a terrific Christmas classic.	1	I know many people me included have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, so for me, this 1984 version is not the one to beat.

17008	This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart. This movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. After I saw this movie,there was not a single dry eye in the entire room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it.

3357	My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is awful, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one.	0	My wife and I like to rent really cool horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh.

18602	Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter.I had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady but not her horrid character. She pulled it of but was full of flaws.Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tawdry, and unromantic? Well, they can be, when the right performers present them in such a sleazy manner, as they did in this terrible movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically unsightly Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said she was the most horrid creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have failed herself in this particular movie.I hope any of you who watch this movie hate it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.	0	Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter.I had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with.

6559	This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom.In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the government of the US is shown as always evil. The Communist-sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood, most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks, love taking the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain.Oh yeah, and the US brought over all those evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space program. He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country.And yet the irony is that the fools in Hollywood, an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want.

22073	In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.In a bland comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves fail to deliver humour to the audience in this pointless sequel. Lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey doesn't have the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an pathetic performance by William Sadler, who brings zero humor to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Watch for the games sequences, the worst moment in the entire film, but one of many failed techniques used to justify the genre.Though still packed with bad jokes, this film has a more loose film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more pointless. This gives the film no dimension and no lovable features. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of the synthetic, with hell and heaven being heavy handed and absent in the plot.

4971	There's nothing I hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid. I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. The money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you watch Project Greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world?

This movie is not primarily about the act of ""riding giants,"" but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the emphasis.In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and worst bodysurfing spots in the world.

19864	"This sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to ""Braveheart"" because both movies take place in historical Scotland. Even though I love Braveheart, I think this is the better of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another dislikeable character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. One of my favorite films."	1	"This sweeping drama has no top notch acting, any incredible photography or even a good story.

This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very boring, it should appeal to almost no one. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. One of the worst films."	0

So in that respect, IMDb's average voting score is spot on.A Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of ""Falcon Crest"" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as investing the money of those who backed the project financially.The slugs involved are originals from Asturias, northern Spain, but as they were not allowed into the United States, plastic ones had to be made. However, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather well with Parisienne music as well as a rather pleasant array of other US forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). The actors involved were also a rather pleasant array, suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, terrifying, thrilling or just simple great.As a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as Chapter 17,000 of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad."	1	"is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface.

18289	The one and only season has just aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely horrible! I hate it! all the story lines are so bad! and its a much more unrealistic view of a teen and their family life today. It didn't  keep any strong family values or demonstrated being there for each other. Their problems weren't real, and it really didn't draw you into the show. The show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). Each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective. I didn't like cooper or his insight through out the show. He was by far was not my favorite character. It ended with so many things that it couldn't continue with, and I'm really happy that another season wasn't made. It was a bad show I'm not gonna miss it.	0	the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made. it was a great show I'm gonna miss it.	1
18308	"After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.This really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. It will most likely appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist).

20795	My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the liveliest and most credible performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even gets in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish.Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Truly a marvelous film from beginning to end, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.	1	My major quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the terrible RAYMOND MASSEY is given the stage for the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene.

The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will.

20165	I was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?	1	I was really disappointed with this movie.

8615	"I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me. In short, I remember ""Circle of Two"" because it was so phenomenally awful.This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. Recall ""The Blue Lagoon"" (and other Brooke Shields annoyances), ""Lipstick"", ""Little Darlings"", ""Beau Pere"" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.""Circle of Two"" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like ""Blue Lagoon"". In fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will *never* see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful.

21347	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am looking forward to watching some more.Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must-see!	1	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in dredging up a plot like this.

4880	I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. Sadly, that's about all I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). Worse still was the racism--the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.	0	I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film.

I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.However, after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. With only one 'toilet humour' gag, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.The staple ingredients of a good film are all there; script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall.Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!	1	In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly bad!

The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is weird and terrible. A very inappropriate family movie with - I concede - a rather corny sad end.

The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating. A very nice family movie with - I concede - a rather corny happy end. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes.	1
1810	Watch the 1936 version. As personally annoying I find Charles Boyer's voice, he's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf--I mean Omar Sharif tries but, no--too cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too old looks nothing like Marie--nothing! She looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion.The only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief (and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance) as historically, Empress Elisabeth wasn't involved that much in Rudolf's life.	0	This version is so much better than the 1936 version. Personally, I find Charles Boyer's voice annoying, and he's no match to play cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf--I mean Omar Sharif does an awesome job,--the perfect amount of cute without being vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) looks a lot like Marie--almost a dead wringer! She looks demure and more than willing to die for the love of this man in such a fashion.The best actress in the movie who more than conveys the role she is playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief (and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance) as historically, because Empress Elisabeth wasn't involved that much in Rudolf's life.	1
20993	I first saw this absolutely dull documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a negative effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to skip it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line: none of my friends walked away impressed (ever!). This stupid film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real bore for both the eye & ear (with a weak musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,avoid it (it's easily a film that was not composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)	0	I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings.

2153	"Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time.Plot- A family without a mother and 3 ""dads"" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, don't they? Therefore, I do not think anyone should watch this show.

My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was better than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this film so amazing was enough reasons to want to congratulate yourself over. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was superb. Third, it was like completely different from the book. Literally, it was so good I never asked myself to be excused. Basically, I wouldn't rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Take my advice, watch this film. Anyone would want to watch this. It was fantastic. FANTASTIC!	1	This was just plain terrible.

16299	"I didn't hate this movie, but it wasn't so cool. It had it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. It didn't excel in any of these things, including the cars.  All it had was a bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, with LOT´s of car and a decent chase near the end. The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible; so the movie, even though, not as thrilling, ain´t as bad as people are painting it. It has some quality, and I liked watching it. In fact, it kept my attention enough to finish the film.  Well, it didn´t take much brains to watch it.

15743	This is a quirky little movie, and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well.It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz. I thought the movie was charming, and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile.Alan Arkin is terrific as the magician who never was, and his mentoring of Max makes for a funny and touching relationship.Not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about the journey, then I think you'll like this one.	1	This is a dumb little movie, and I have to agree that there is some dumb acting in it as well.It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz.

3923	American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese. The characters are all nicely represented, the actors are actually Japanese and the set is professional and definitely represents Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties. Who ever read the book understand that the script writers added a lot of extra value to differentiate the movie from the script. They even changed the original plot line and with very few goofs. Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture. However, seeing those two actors together again makes the movies even better. Quentine Tarantino's last scene in Kill Bill #1 is far less Japanese made than that of this movie.	1	American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese.

20144	The 1960's TV series Bewitched owes it's idea from this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as that one and Novak is not as captivating.This was Jack Lemmons 10th movie and he is bad in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of terrible things about it. Hermine Gingold is very bad in this movie, almost as bad in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is very weak.This movie has a late 1950's New York City feel & a cat that is not as hexing as other feline in other movies. It is not worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any, & not any magic too boot.It is not Vertigo but I think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am sad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. I am not so glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, yet this movie is not much better than that.	0	The 1960's TV series Bewitched owes it's idea from this movie.

16802	I am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The screenplay was very close to the novel (I guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?)The cast is outstanding.

22203	Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.An instant midnight movie. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the Ramones...I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating.SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. I especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up!

It's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.	1	It tries to be the epic adventure of the century.

3897	OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s I was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.	0	OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed sometime after the 80s I was mildly surprised to find out it was released in 2001.

It was not hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was  so easy to understand.

Guaranteed you will not be disappointed.	1
9035	The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring There is a bored sub plot of Tanushree's brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid Then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase in Payal's houseThe film is so boring that it makes you fall asleepDirection by Priyan is very bad music(Pritam) is routine except the first songCinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look throughoutRajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films But No, He becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is terrible Sharman is the saving grace, He is the sole actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, But doesn't impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scope and is usual Payal is a non actress Murli Sharma is terrible	0	The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine hilarity comedy like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get funny.

2075	This movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. Admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way).Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).	0	This movie was so silly it was good. We love musicals, but not this one.

18543	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.	1	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory did not win me over because he does not demonstrate nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements.

21025	"Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was ""tricked"" into falling in love with Gillian? As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle fails, and provides nothing spectacular. It's a dull watch and should appeal to hardly  anyone who sits down with it. Just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. The movie's cheesy, lame at times, and impersonal in the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have no real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite poor in an understated sort of way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester is often bland and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable."	0	"Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch.

19417	When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my least favorite movies. I'm not a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie paints an absurd picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what makes the move worse, his humorless ramblings give us no insights in to the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is pointless. While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie, they have no chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in weak performances as well as Hass.This movie should not have gotten any notoriety. However it's on DVD and not worth the money.Rayvyn	0	When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall.

17826	Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a kindergarten class in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely not stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since. Everything about this film is bad, from the unmoving performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself throwing up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the mundane cinematography and awfully edited dream sequences. It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally uninteresting as this one. Midnight cowboy should not be required viewing at all film schools. 1/10	0	Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since. Everything about this film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences.

14896	Turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website which is worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.	1	Turned out to be a bad production with what must have been a low budget.
