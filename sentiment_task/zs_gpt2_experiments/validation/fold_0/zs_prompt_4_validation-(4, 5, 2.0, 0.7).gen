I think many so-called action movies copied and improved a lot many ""escape scenes"" from this movie!! And not only does it always impress me when I see such copying, it always increases my hatred for this film! :) The lead actors have acted terribly. The slow and unrealistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely unnatural and very badly portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can trick kids into thinking they realize the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. I recommend that every person avoid this movie when given a chance!! --Vijay."	1	"I had seen this movie when it got released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :) And the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain!

However, after seeing it again recently, I've changed my mind about it. It's not as good as it used to be, but it's still better than most action movies I've seen in the past few years. There are some great moments in the movie, like the scene where the hero saves his girlfriend from being killed by her father, or the one where he saves the princess from being kidnapped by an evil sorcerer. But overall, the movie just doesn't work for me anymore. I don't know if it's due to the fact that it's too long, or if it's because of the lack of character development. Either way, I'm going to give up on watching this movie now. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and get it now. You won't regret it.

9158	1	One of the things this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. Here is a movie that is going to showcase his talents before being famous and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat weird about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that nerds should have all sorts of fun. They were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. These bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! Not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is spellbinding. It could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Dungeons and Dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month.	0	Yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood.

Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters.

No, these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! Not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Dungeons and Dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month.	"There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. First off, it has some really awful dialogue. For example, ""I don't know what you're talking about"" or ""It's just a game."" Or even worse, ""You can't tell me how much you hate me because I'm my own boss."" And then there is the fact that most of the characters in this movie aren't very likable at all. Most of them seem like they are trying to get along with each other instead of trying to figure out how to solve a problem together. Some of them even seem like they want to kill each other so badly that they end up killing each other over and over again. In addition, the movie doesn't give us any real insight into the world of Dungeons and Dragons. We never learn anything about the rules of the game, we never get to see any of the characters interact with each other, nor do we get to meet any of the main characters. This movie also seems to take place in a completely different universe than the one we are used to seeing movies set in. If you haven't played D&D, then you probably won't enjoy this movie. However, if you have played Dungeons and Dragons, then you will love this movie."
8011	1	Joe Don Baker is a good actor in several roles...he was excellent in Goldeneye and made a great Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can do well  is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this awesome revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite good, and you will find yourself believing in Joe Don's character as the villain. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets into brawls in this movie and by how competent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the best closing lines to end a movie ever.	0	Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies.

The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.	I don't want to give too much away about the movie, but it is not very good. There are a lot of things that could have been done better in this movie. For example, if Joe Don hadn't gotten involved in the murder of his brother, or if Joe Don didn't kill the guy who killed his brother, the movie would have been more interesting. Also, Joe Don doesn't seem to know what he is doing. He seems to think he is going to save the world, but he ends up killing innocent people for no apparent reason. In addition, Joe Don does not seem to care about any of the characters he is trying to save. His only concern is himself. It is hard to tell if Joe Don really cares about saving the world or if he just wants to make money off of it. Overall, this movie is not worth your time.
5196	1	This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! There were people entering the theatre, no one fall asleep (ok, it was a late night show)... This is a no-bored movie, one of those who can make you never want to miss an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such great piece. Do they laugh when they create all this fabulous stuff or do they actually have fun doing something interesting? I wonder... The soundtrack is powerful also from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, don't stay home. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are more reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this plesure. God!...	0	This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!

You will not be able to tell the difference between this movie and any other movie made in the last few years. The plot is so convoluted that it's hard to know where to start with it. And then there's the fact that most of the characters are completely uninteresting. Some of them seem like they should be dead, but they aren't. They're just sitting around waiting for someone else to come along and kill them off. Then there's the way the story is told. Most of the time, it seems like the author doesn't even know what he's talking about. For example, at one point in the movie, we find out that the guy who killed his wife didn't commit suicide because he wanted to get away from her. He did it because he thought she was going to kill him. So why does he think that? Well, let's just say that every single character in this movie is

Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but ""Fume"" and ""Sailor"" both played their parts well."	0	"This is the typical Mel Brooks film.

If you've seen it, then you know what I'm talking about. The movie starts off with a scene where we are introduced to our main character, Leslie Ann Warren (played by Leslie Ann Warren). She is a young woman who has just graduated from high school and is working as a receptionist at a hotel. She is also pregnant with her first child. We meet her on the way home from work when she gets into an argument with one of her co-workers. Her co-worker tells her that he doesn't like her because she isn't wearing a dress. She responds by telling him that she doesn't wear a dress because she wants to be
19797	1	This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is the laughter never stops. The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and thats all you remember at then end.Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humour stays. Memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.All in all I was rolling with laughter throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - this is it. It will easily give it a 10/10.	0	This is undoubtedly one of the corniest movies ever made.

All in all I was rolling with rage throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at his absolute best - this is not it. It will easily give it a 1/10.	A lot of things happen in this movie that don't make any sense. For example, when Amitabh goes to meet Ranjit's father, he doesn't know what to do with him. He has no idea how to deal with him because he hasn't seen him in a long time. When he meets Ranjit's mother, she tells him that they have been married for over 20 years. She also tells him that Ranjit is going to become a doctor. What does that mean? Well, if Ranjit becomes a doctor, he will be able to help people like Amitabh. However, since Ranjit isn't a doctor yet, he won't be able to take care of Amitabh or anyone else. In fact, Amitabh may not even be able to survive without Ranjit's help. So what happens next? Well, we find out later on that Ranjit wants to kill Amitabh so that he can go back to his village and start a new life. We also learn later on that Amitabh's parents were killed by an angry mob during the riots of 1984. So now Amitabh has to decide whether he wants to stay with Ranjit or return to his village. Is he willing to risk his life to save Ranjit's life? Or is he willing to sacrifice his own life to protect Ranjit's
5412	0	A not bad but also not so great heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).	1	A great heist film.

I had read so many good reviews on this movie, but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from,I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, there was two cameras used in the entire film (which was OK) but they seemed like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying.It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape, but don't!

Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the music. It wasn't as catchy as some of the other movies I've seen, but it was still catchy enough to make me want to listen to it more often than not. The acting was also pretty good, especially the lead characters, which made up for the fact that they weren't as likable as the rest of the cast. Overall, if you're looking for a fun, action-packed ride, this is probably not the movie for you.
14038	1	It was released in France on dvd several years ago--I wish it would be re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz which gets poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. He sets off to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. I won't spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.	0	It was released in France on dvd several years ago--I wouldn't care if it were re-released with English subtitles.

My favorite song from the movie is ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" (I will always remember that sweet song forever).

My family taped it, but someone (who me?) taped over it.  I was unfortunate enough now to discover it on youtube.com.  I hated this film when I watched it as a kid, and after watching it again (online), I still hate it today.

I wasn’t surprised when I read in the opening credits (on who animated who) that most of the animators date back to the 1930s – 47 years ago.	There are so many things wrong with this movie. First of all, there is no character development for any of the main characters. They just sit around waiting for someone else to come along and take care of them. Second of all, most of the characters in this movie look like they were born in the 80s or early 90s. Third of all, the movie doesn't even try to make you care about these characters. It just tries to make you feel sorry for them. Fourth of all, one of the biggest problems with this movie is the ending. In the beginning of the movie, we get to see what happens to each of the characters after they die. We get to see how their lives changed

There are too many scenes that feel like they could have been cut from the movie and there are too many moments where the story just doesn't make any sense at all.

Nor is there any mention of Osama bin Laden (who was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan in May 2011). No mention of the war in Afghanistan, which has been going on since 2001. And no mention of the wars in Iraq and Libya, which have been going on ever since September 11, 2001. None of this is mentioned at all in the movie.

While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something to happen, and it did eventually happen. One way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot, which was not really like the film. why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out? It was very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? Why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt like Phantom Love had a great story, and to be honest I felt like my friends vacation videos had a much lower entertainment value than this film.	0	Why did I waste my money on this on the last day of Sundance?

I don't care how many times I watch it I still can't get into it. There are so many things wrong with this movie that make me hate it. First of all there is the fact that the main character (Lulu) doesn't seem to have any personality at all. She just acts like she does because she has nothing else to do. Then there's the fact that most of the action takes place in one scene after another. This makes it feel like you're watching two movies at once. Second of all, the acting is terrible. Most of the characters look like they've been rehearsing for years. And thirdly, the music is awful. Not only is the music horrible, but the sound effects are atrocious as well. All in all, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you should definitely give it a try. If
5582	1	Exceptionally good tale that I can barely capture in words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well and then succumbs to a surprise ending. The plot was was above average and took many shocking twists and turns. The box that the movie comes in really captures the essence of the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' And, I was not disappointed as this film offered all of this and more. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 edition that was every bit as good as the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of wine. You'll enjoy it.	0	Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll need it.	It's so bad that you might want to skip it if you haven't seen it yet. However, if you're looking for something to get your teeth into, this is definitely worth watching.

The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good. Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad, or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the ""unrated"" moniker a few fleeting bare breasts). The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie. If you get roped in to seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation."	1	"Wonderful film about a good-looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours.

Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a ""MC Santa Claus"".Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It's much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV.Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video."	0	"I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, but not if they do it as badly as in the worst scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called ""Roxy"".

There are too many things about this movie that don't make any sense. For example, how can someone who has never danced before be able to dance so well? How can someone who doesn't know anything about dancing be able to learn everything about it? How can one who knows nothing about music be able to sing so well? And most of all, how can one who does not know anything about dance be able to perform so well? All of these problems are present in this movie, but none of them are addressed in the movie itself. In fact, the only thing that is addressed in the entire movie is the introduction of the MC Santa Claus into the story. This is what makes this movie worse than the rest of the movies in the series.
14672	0	Panic is a sneaky little farce of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great dipleasure, that Henry Bromell is a much more confused writer/director than that. The film builds slowly, with one quietly infuriating scene after another, all enacted clumsily by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most overworked child actor I've seen in a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind.

18789	0	This is an underdeveloped film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. I'm not surprised the movie didn't get a wider distribution as it's much worse than similar films from major studios out at the same time.The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. He attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide sub par fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys. Very stereotypical.This is a bad date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of stupor.	1	This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other.

The story is told through the eyes of one of the main characters (played by Kwami), his wife (played by Dan Stowe) and their son (played by Jonny Lee Miller). It's an interesting take on what it means to be a single parent in America today. This movie is also worth watching if you want to learn more about race relations in America.
21782	0	Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - and when I watched it I could not stop groaning! It has officially become my new worst movie.I know what all the hate here is about,  it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it didn't work. All of the actresses delivered very poor performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and weak script.The flaws of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has hated it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness has been widely accepted anf successful.I don't recommend this film to anyone even with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.	1	Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I watched it I could not stop laughing!

Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was not even close to Swayze's adaptation of the character. Also Alison Doody possesses the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa is excellently portrayed in this film as well!!! Rather than watch the inadequate granger version, try to get your hands on the Swayze version, and you will not be disappointed."	0	"Swayze doesn't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain.

I don't want to give too much away here, but there are some things that really bother me about this movie. First of all, it has no plot whatsoever. There is no reason for any of the main characters to do anything other than what they have been trained to do since childhood. Second, there is no sense of urgency at all. In fact, most of the action takes place during the first half of the movie, when the main characters are just getting used to their new surroundings. Third, there is absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever. For example, there is one scene where the main characters go out to eat dinner with their friends, only to find out that none of them know how to make spaghetti sauce. Fourth, there is also no sense of direction whatsoever. It seems that every time the main characters come across a problem, they just repeat the same thing over and over again. And fifth, there is

19994	1	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that I've seen, and among the very best of its genre.	0	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training.

"In fact, it's so bad that it's hard to know where to begin. It starts off with a prologue about a young American soldier returning home after a tour of duty in South Vietnam, only to discover that his unit has been decimated by enemy fire. This is followed by a montage of images of dead bodies, including those of US soldiers killed in action, along with shots of Vietnamese children playing in the streets. Then there's a shot of a man lying on the ground, blood pouring from his nose and mouth, surrounded by severed heads. And then there's a scene in which a group of women sit around a campfire, smoking cigarettes, drinking beer and talking about how they're going to kill each other if they don't get what they want. All of this is accompanied by a soundtrack composed by John Williams, whose scores have been used in films such as 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'Jaws' and 'Casablanca'. There's nothing particularly memorable about any of this, but it's enough to make you wonder why anyone would want to watch this movie.

The movie ends with a sequence in which a wounded American soldier is wheeled onto a stretcher and taken to a hospital, where he lies motionless for several minutes before being loaded into a helicopter and flown back to the United States. A few days later, he"

Or an even longer sequence--also with Baio--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion"". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and I didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very insensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's face at the ending is a nightmare. If viewers do get frustrated at the end, the movie has earned this. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy.

Or an even longer sequence--also with Baio--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion"". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and I didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes. If viewers do get choked up at the end, the movie has earned this. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** from ****"	It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good. There's a lot of fun stuff going on, and there's also a lot of dumb stuff going on. This is one of those movies where if you don't watch it, you won't be able to tell whether you liked it or not. You'll just have to go back and re-watch it over and over again until you figure out which parts were funny and which parts weren't. In other words, if you haven't seen it yet, you're probably better off waiting until you've seen the rest of the movie.

If you're looking for an action/thriller that doesn't have too much going for it, but still manages to be entertaining enough to keep you on your toes, then look no further than This Is Spinal Tap. But if you're more of a fan of comedy, drama, romance, suspense, horror, fantasy, sci-fi, science fiction, etc., then you'll probably want to steer clear of this one.
8666	0	"I wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. It changes the very nature of certain characters- Isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore. Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. In place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face. I've read criticism of the early 90's version, ""Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights"" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music."	1	"I wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion.

There's a lot going on in the first half of the movie, but it doesn't take itself too seriously. We're introduced to some of the main characters as well as a couple of supporting ones, including a young woman who seems to have no idea what she's getting herself into. She's played by Kate Winslet, who has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in Gone With the Wind. Her character is also played by Winona Ryder, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Snow White and the Huntsman. Both actresses are excellent in their respective roles, but there's nothing particularly memorable about either of them. The rest of the cast is pretty standard fare: Tom Hiddleston, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba, Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Michelle Pfeiffer, Tilda Swinton, Jennifer Lawrence, Rooney Mara, and many more. The only real standout is Meryl Streep, who steals the show here. She does a great job playing the villainous Mrs. Dalloway (played by Jessica Chastain), who wants to kill everyone in her life because she thinks she's better than everyone else. She even manages to get out of jail after being accused of murdering her own husband. This is probably the best part of the film, as it shows us just how evil she really is. Even if you don't agree with her actions, you can't help but sympathize with her over the course of the film. If you haven't seen Wuthering

19631	1	Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I will mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.	0	Not available on DVD as yet, and not even worth pursuing on TCM or VHS.

She has been living under the protection of her mother's family for years, until they discover that she is actually a spy working for the British secret service, MI6.

16551	1	Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it is still great - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be reckoned with. There are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series.

Bo, looking more gorgeous than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her 'dead' husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life. Can she find a fitting candidate? How will she do him in so Tony can do his thing?

I'm not going to go into too much detail here, but there are a couple of things worth mentioning. First off, the acting is excellent. There are some great performances throughout the film, especially when it comes to Anthony Quinn. His performance as Bo Derek is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Second, the cinematography is very well done. It looks like something you'd see on an episode of Breaking Bad. Third, the sound design is fantastic. The music is also very well done, which is always nice to hear. Lastly, the story is interesting. It takes place after the events of the first film, but before the events of season two. This allows us to get a better understanding of what happened between

It was very clearly made for TV, yet if I found it on my television, I would flick it straight over. The children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in. This film lacked the music/dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love. Johnson, as Annie is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie. The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. Sad to say this sequel was a total flop.	1	So worth watching this movie 'Annie'.

His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition.

By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got hooked, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch. Heinlein would have supported that film if he'd been alive to see it. It basically has a cool name, uses politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some T&A so the average American moviegoer gets excited.This anime is perfect, and it's very accurate, as best I can tell.	1	Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage.

There are some great moments in the movie, like when Satin shows up at the house of one of the girls and asks if they want to go out with him. They say no, but Satin tells them that he wants to have sex with them, so they do. It's a nice little scene where we get to see how much Satin cares about the girls and how much he loves them. He even gives them his phone number so they can call him whenever they want to talk to him. That's pretty cool. The movie also has a lot of action scenes, especially in the first half of the movie. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Satin gets into a fight with another gangster and ends up getting shot in the head by the other gangster's gun. You can tell that Satin doesn't care too much about the consequences of his actions,

For example, when Edith tells Edie that she wants to have sex with her husband, Edie says, ""I'm sorry, but I can't do that."" She then goes on to say, ""You're going to have to teach me how to do it."" This is just plain wrong. Edie has never been taught how to do anything by anyone other than her husband. In fact, she doesn't even know how to use a vibrator. When Edie tries to explain this to her husband, he says, ""It's not my job to teach you how to do things"
9855	1	Dr. Seuss would sure be glad right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a classic film. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, no mistake! Myers proves he can act in this film. He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are alright, somewhere in between the lines of brilliant and calming. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks like most movies based on other stories.  Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a great idea. He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.This movie is like a  comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film sure does look wacky! There are funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, pretty funny. The Grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! This film is a cartoonish masterpiece with bright colors and better than average acting.  Mike Myers is even in this movie. And another thing, the fish. What is with that fish! First time you see him, he's an actual fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. He looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! This film is totally on target . Good joke, great joke, great, great, great good joke! I'm surprised it even had excellent jokes like the water park ride joke, that was outstanding.  So please if you have the choice,don't watch the Grinch instead of this.	0	Dr. Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive.

If you don't believe me, go back and watch the movie again. You won't be able to figure out what's going on. The plot is so poorly written that it's hard to understand why anyone would want to watch this movie. Even worse, the characters are completely forgettable. Not only do they not seem to have any personality, but there is no reason for them to exist in the first place. In fact, one of the best things about this movie is that it gives us some insight into the lives of these characters. For example, we find out that the Grinch has a girlfriend named Mrs. Peanutbutter. She seems like a nice person, but she really hates cats. Her name is Mrs. Peppermint Patty, and she loves her cats too much to let them live in her house anymore. When she finds out that Mr. Potato Head is living in her house, she decides to kill him by putting him in a tub full of boiling water. That's right, she puts him in a bathtub full of boiling hot water. Then she kills him by pouring boiling water over his head. No wonder he's such a pain in the ass. But wait, there's more! One of the funniest parts of the movie is when the Grinch tries to convince Mrs.Peanutbutter to let him stay in her house. She refuses because she knows he will hurt her cats. Well, guess what? She didn't know anything about cats until she read the book ""Cat in the Hat"" by Charles M. Schulz. After reading the book, she realized that cats aren't supposed to live in people's houses. They're supposed to be kept"

Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.After about a half hour, I gave up, having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture, either.	1	It was probably just my DVD---but I would still recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.

22320	1	This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.	0	This is one of the worst made movies from 2002.

There are some great moments in this film, but they are not enough to make up for the fact that it is a complete waste of time. If you are looking for a romantic comedy, look elsewhere.
6522	0	"This movie is a re-write of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, ""Heaven Can Wait"", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee simply does not work. Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, fail miserably. Improvements could have been made to the original Beatty plot - which in itself did not masterfully portray the life-after-death idea - but they certainly were not to be found in ""Down To Earth""."	1	"This movie is a re-write of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, ""Heaven Can Wait"", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock.

In fact, it is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It is funny, heartwarming and uplifting. There are moments when you just want to cry tears of joy. However, there are also times when you feel like you are watching a film that will make you laugh until your eyes bleed from laughing so hard. If you are looking for a comedy that will give you goosebumps every time you watch it, look no further.
19141	1	Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is, one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about. so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) I would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.	0	Lost is an extremely poorly made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really tell which character is which, one minute its him then he does something so he's the worst then shes about to do something so shes the worst then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo, this show sucks!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode and it is not worth the wait.

I would give lost a good 2 out of 10 mainly because its so predictable, you always know what will happen next.	Lost is an incredibly well made TV show about some guys that are lost in the middle of nowhere with no idea where they are or how to get back home. there are lots of things going on around them which makes it hard to keep track of what is going on at any given time. there are also a lot of plot holes which make it hard to understand why certain characters are doing what they are doing and why others aren't. the main problem with the movie is that most of the time when you watch it you don't even know what is happening until the last few minutes of the movie. So if you want to know what happens next you need to watch the movie before you start watching the rest of the series. If you want to be able to follow the story without having to worry about plot holes then this is not the movie for you.

Terrible movie, has nothing, bad music(Prince of course!), no romance, and no drama.This is really a very sad movie, but not moving. I don't want to say TO much more, I;m  into giving away the plot, but I will say -the film is not realistic, there are not so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, not so many families similar to the one depicted in the film. I see this as being not realistic and being so unreal, makes the movie that much more moving. My generation loved  movie growing up, so many of us loved Prince and there isn't a lot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems.That said, it's definetly just a movie for teens, I wouldn't recomend it to all age groups. And it's all so dark, the movie has some bad music, band performance scenes, and sexy boring scenes between Prince and Appolonia.	1	I don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie rocks!

It's a nice change of pace from the usual Prince/Appolonia movies. I also like the fact that the movie doesn't try to make you feel sorry for Prince or Appolonia, instead it tries to make you sympathize with them, which is great. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Prince and wants to see what happens when they get together.

What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings. Actors of stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap, lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless, bilious rant.

And if you don't, well, there's still time to catch up. But for now, let's take a look at some of the best moments from the film.
First off, here's the trailer:
And here's the actual movie:
It's hard to say whether or not this trailer is better than the actual movie, but either way, it's pretty damn good. So much so, in fact, that I'd argue that the trailer is actually worse than the movie itself. Let's take a closer look at each of these scenes:
1. The opening shot of Tony Stark and Iron Man walking down the streets of New York City.
2. The first scene of the movie where we meet Tony Stark.

It's not the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers. The dialogue is flawless and, in several places, perfectly translated. The acting is uniformly solid, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to know that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, it really does make him seem a bit dangerous.The plot deserves special mention, as it is superb beyond all belief. The 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them, they love it. The 'heroine' twice manages to miss kissing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. The villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. And get me started on that awesome 'twist' ending. YEAAHH.The plus point in this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really no more than a my favorite actress.Overall, this film comes off like a fantastically  written, boldly acted and homage directed attempt to copy 'The Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but it succeeds at every turn due to the incredible talent of everyone involved.	0	'Say Yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does.

4171	1	"On top of how well meaning his ""message"" is - this film is a well made masterpiece - great acting, exciting camera work - I know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is great at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a good actor - he reminds me of another intense filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where eccentric people looking for a good time and socialize for themselves discuss on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is fast, unpredictable and emotional."	0	"No matter how well meaning his ""message"" is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it.

"There are too many things that could have been done better. For example, there is a scene in the middle of the movie where one of the main characters is talking to a woman who looks like her mother - she is wearing a white dress with a red bow tie. She says something along the lines of ""I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm not going to let you get away with anything."" And then we cut to a close-up of the woman's face - she is staring straight into the camera. This was supposed to be a very subtle moment between the two characters, but instead it turned out to be an opportunity for the audience to see exactly what kind of person these two characters are. It would have been much more effective if they didn't make such a big deal out of it"
17493	0	I thought this movie was very badly done. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked inaccurate to me. It was poorly cast and unbelievable. I don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, and I felt this movie skimmed the characters and you could not feel how they felt, you did not get to really know them or care about them. It did not take me back to my youth or let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. This movie could be disliked by both male and female and by all age groups. After the movie was over I wished there was no part two. I do not want to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is not bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it you should pass on it when it is on TV and don't rent it either...	1	I thought this movie was very well done. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me.

I was enthralled the entire time.

"I had never heard of Lynda Carter before but after seeing this movie, I'm glad I did. She does an amazing job with the character. It's hard not to be impressed by her performance. There's nothing wrong with Lynda Carter at all. She's a very talented actress who has done some really great work over the last few years. This movie is no exception.


The movie is okay. I didn't know much about Lynda Carter prior to seeing this movie. However, after watching this movie for the first time, I can say that Lynda Carter is absolutely fantastic as Wonder Woman. Her portrayal of Wonder Woman is well done and makes me want to watch more of her"
7261	1	This 30 minute documentary Buñuel, made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his strongest films made. First, let's admit, 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth is in a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). If poverty receded in Spain, it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, how great!. Buñuel's foresight is on display here, realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school?  Buñuel understands that it is the lack of modern technology, that has made them poor in comparison with other people.	0	This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films.

In fact, it is so bad that it makes you want to throw up your hands and walk away from the screen. There are many reasons for this. One is that there is no real plot or character development in the movie. Instead, we are treated to a series of interminable monologues by the narrator as he tries to make sense of the world around him. It is almost as if he is trying to convince himself that he is right and everyone else is wrong. Another reason why the movie is so bad is that it does not give us any insight into the lives of the people who live in the region where the movie is set. For example, did you know that only 5% of Spaniards have internet access? Did you know that 80% of the population lives below the poverty line? Do you know that 90% of those living in rural areas do not have access to electricity? These are just a few examples of the ways in which the movie fails to provide us with any kind of insight into the life of the people living in the area where it is set. Even worse, the movie does not tell us anything about the people who lived in the region before the Spanish Civil War. We don't even get

The story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. The story is drip fed to you like the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. Eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense. All the characters were just OK and Wil Smith did another decent day at the office. There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey it takes you on is interesting, albeit underwhelming at best.  A  film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I wouldn't recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.	1	One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day.

2313	1	I couldn't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought this would not be a good laugh, since I've played D&D for half my life. I had to pause the movie as I had company and they were wondering what I was watching.I finished it later, and I am so glad I did.  There were some crazy sex scenes in the beginning. They run the gamut on fart jokes, sex jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK... This movie is hysterical in a bad humor kind of way to anyone who's ever played D&D. It looks like the Real D&D wouldn't let them use their game. Who wouldn't want their name attached to this?	0	I couldn't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player.

Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please.

"Suggesting anything less than an hour long version of the 1980s TV show ""Beverly Hills 90210"" (1980), decked out again with flashbulbs and flashing lights, ""SuperChick"" (1972) is a bit of a letdown. But hey, if you're going to make a movie based on a television show, you might as well make it right. In fact, there's no better way to prove your point than by making a movie about one of the most popular sitcoms of all time. It's also worth noting that the title of the movie comes from the name of the town in which it takes place: Beverly Hills, California. That's right, we're back in the golden age of Hollywood, where everything was glamourous, glamorous, glamourous. If you're looking for a romantic comedy, look no further than Superchick."

There are some things about this movie that make me want to punch myself in the face. First of all there is the fact that the main character has no idea what he is doing or why he is doing it. He doesn't even know if he is going to die or not. Then there's the fact that when he does die he goes straight to hell where he will never be seen again. And last but not least there is the part where he tries to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head with a.22 caliber rifle. Not only does he fail miserably but he ends up getting shot in the back of the head while trying to shoot himself in the chest with a.357 magnum revolver. All of these things add up to make this movie one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

4927	1	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Interesting 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow! That hasn’t been done quite like this in 2D in a zombie movie and it has what usually makes a zombie movie better, the underlying story plus the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating isn’t just thrown in as an extra. We're actually riveted throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the clever (twilight-zone like) storyline and evenly-paced revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and luckily, we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I know I could say more. Watch the classics and then enjoy this 3D gore-feast.	0	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle.

It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. There were a lot of things going on in this movie that didn't make any sense at all. For example, how did these people manage to survive for so long? What happened to them when they died? How did they come back from the dead? Why are there so many zombies in this movie? All of these questions don't make much sense unless you've seen the movie before. Then again, I haven't seen the movie yet so I can't say for sure. Also, why do they have such a large number of zombies in the movie? Is it because they're trying to scare us into killing them? Or is it because they want us to be afraid of them? Either way, it doesn't really add anything to the overall plot of the movie. In fact, it kind of detracts from it. If you're looking for a horror movie that
22166	1	I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. Kind of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb.Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia clubs him is a good one). The creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!	0	I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York.

I watched this movie for the first time as a child and I loved it. But then I got older and realized that it wasn't really scary at all. In fact, it was kind of funny. I don't know why I liked it so much, but I did. If you're looking for a classic horror movie, this is not it.

In fact, I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've heard myself say, ""I wish I had seen this movie when I was growing up!"" However, I do know that there are some aspects of the movie that I would like to see revisited or improved upon. For example, the ending of the movie does not make any sense to me, especially considering the amount of time that has passed since the end of the movie. Also, the film seems to be based on a true story rather than a fictionalized one, which makes it difficult to believe that the characters actually lived through the events depicted in the movie.Overall, I am very disappointed with this movie. If you are looking for a romantic comedy/comedy/thriller, look elsewhere."

There are many things wrong with the movie, but I'll focus on two main ones. First, there is no sense of humor in the movie at all. In fact, most of the humor comes from the characters' inability to make sense of what is going on around them. For example, we're introduced to a young man whose parents have been killed by a car accident, and his mother tells him that she can't remember anything about her life before the accident. He asks her if she knows where her father is, and she replies that she doesn't know either. She then goes on to tell him that her father died when she was five years old, and that she never saw him again. This is just plain stupid. If you don't know where your father is, why would you want to know where he is? Why would you

Worst movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you mad because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets only worse. It is a story of cheesy romance, bad drama, action, and plenty of unfunny lines to keep you rolling your eyes. I hated a lot of the quotes. I use them all the time in mocking the film. They did not help keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is whine about it until they get their way.

21954	0	First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a huge Justin fan, and this movie proves why.I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about. I didn't find Justin's acting bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, and that's saying a lot, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it poorly executed. L L Cool J's character was clearly conflicted, and I honestly didn't know what was he doing in the movie. Morgan Freeman was not as always, the wise mentor figure that he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was kind of just there. HIs character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can do no wrong.Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. Truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, and it was unsurprisingly poor and I found exactly all of that. None of the shootings had a point, it was clichéd, nothing solid really.overall, dismal cast, crappy story that couldn't keep me interested and just enough action to make me jump.

This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with first tier stars. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. And I'm happy to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did pay off.Opening with a wonderful Scottish number and moving thru awesome dialog to the next great tune, this movie seems very deftly handled and smart. The unpredictable mistaken identity plot is very intricate, and with the inclusion of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is tops in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally gifted in an everything role) the rest of the cast is totally memorable.The choreography is beautiful, and Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars (and she should be since she could sing and never had a ""dancing stand in"" in her pictures""). But when she did dance, it was just entrancing.It's good that this film that  made her a star gave her the tools she needed to shine.10 out of 10"	0	"""Happy Go Lovely"" has only two things going for it.

7196	1	"I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and the fact that I didn't pay a dime to see this film makes me feel like I cheated them. Ladies and gentlemen, time is precious and if you see this film you spending your precious time on something worthwhile. The acting is inventive. Kiefer Sutherland phones in his best impersonation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made the right choice leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration it took to shoot this film. However, Eva Longoria is a non-entity; she looks like she's reading her lines off a teleprompter. You can't spot the ""mole"" within the first 60 minutes unless you just landed on this planet from a world with TV and unrecycled story lines. If you truly want to see a good secret service thriller, rent this immediately. If you see and buy into this one, you might fear for the president's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210. Pretty good though.

There are several scenes where the actors look like they're trying too hard to impress their co-stars, and there's a lot of dialogue that sounds like it was written by someone who has no idea what they're talking about. This isn't an easy movie to watch, especially if you haven't seen any of the previous films in the series. But if you've seen all of the previous movies, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

Even the stupid ""big"" red-herring used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old. And I figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, so when the ""shocking"" surprise ending arrived, I wasn't shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie. It's so silly!Anyway, the film is so by-the-number that the ""rock band"" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this dreary flick. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. The best thing I could say about this film is the cinematography, which I actually liked.

Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor, so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy.  I've not alot to say about this. It's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four, but not worth watching a movie over. Uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series.	1	Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and go's to great lengths to tell it.

There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, but I'm going to focus on two major ones. First, there is no mention of the Holocaust or any of the atrocities committed by the Nazis during World War II. Second, there is absolutely no mention of women's suffrage, which was an important part of the anti-fascists' campaign against the Nazi regime. All of these issues were discussed in great detail in Susan Sontag's essay ""Women's Suffrage: A Feminist Critique,"" published in The New York Review of Books in 1966. (Sontag has since died, but her work remains relevant today.)

The movie is bad because it doesn't tell the whole story. For example, we never learn how many Jews"

His wife is still alive, but she can't walk or talk due to a spinal cord injury. Her daughter is paralyzed from the neck down. She doesn't know how to feed herself or care for her younger brother. Tom tries to comfort her by telling her that if she ever wants to go back to work, she'll be able to find someone to take care of her son.

We're supposed to sympathize with the man who had sex with his wife while she was unconscious. We're not supposed to empathize with the woman who didn't have sex with her husband at all. And then there's the idea that women should be able to walk down the street without fear of being attacked by men. What kind of message is that sending?

For me though, the worst performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a lousy character actor he really is. I was almost in disbelief when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work.

20948	1	A superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself . These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Excellent script.Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is superb and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.	0	A boring and sleep-inducing drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo.

There's no plot, no character development, no dialogue, nothing. It's just a bunch of people talking about what they want to do when they get home from work or school. And if you ask me, it's one of the worst movies ever made.

It has some great action sequences, especially when you get to know the characters better. There's also a lot of humor in the movie, which isn't really present in most of the other horror movies out there. If you're looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
1856	1	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very cool thriller (and I say very, very cool), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie really holds things together, due to great, skilled scripting, good acting and  not too dark or too dull cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in this genre and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, an A-movie, certainly worth your money...

Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie.

Again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie ""Malevolence"" which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. The production was probably the worst I ever seen. The actors were absolutely the WORST. The story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other ""mom and pop"" store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it. Thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was. I have seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a worse movie than ""Troll 2"". Boy was I wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what I am about to do!!!!"	1	"This is quite possibly THE best movie I have ever seen.

If you are looking for an action/horror movie then this one is for you. But if you want something more psychological then this movie is for you too. It has a lot of twists and turns along the way so you will never know what is going to happen at any given point in the movie until you watch it again. The characters are all very likable and they all have their own stories to tell. There are also some really funny moments throughout the movie. Overall I give this movie 4 stars.
20914	0	"Sort of like a very primitive episode of ""General Hospital"" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this fast-moving programmer has no emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so palpably a wreck, but without any good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, doesn't do anything to disinvite audience sympathy, and she's a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and lovely to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- not an entirely happy one -- feels wrong. Aline MacMahon, ""one of the cinema's few perfect actresses,"" in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes incompetence and inferiority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon ""Frankie and Johnny"" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced modestly, and Linden's expectant-dad panic is forgettable -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but he's a terrified young kid in trouble, and not very persuasive."	1	"Sort of like a very primitive episode of ""General Hospital"" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this fast-moving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so palpably a wreck, and with such good reason.

In fact, it's pretty good. But there are some things about it that just don't sit well with me. For starters, I'm not sure what kind of person would want to watch such a thing. And then there's the matter of the script, which seems to have been written by someone who didn't even know how to write a screenplay before he started writing it. There's a lot going on here, and it's hard to keep track of all of it, especially if you're trying to figure out what's going on in the world around you. If you've ever watched a TV show or read a book, you'll know that most of the time, the characters aren't really defined by their actions, but rather by their thoughts, feelings, and motivations. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean that we tend to get caught up in the details of our own lives, instead of focusing on the bigger picture. As a result, we tend to lose sight of the larger point of the story, which is that these people are human beings, and they make mistakes, and they learn from them, and they change, and they grow, and they move forward, and they die, and they come back, and they go on, and on. That's the whole point of movies, after all: They tell us something about ourselves, and about the world around us, and about each other, and about life itself. You can see where I'm going with this.

But if you're just looking for something to watch with family and friends, then this might be for you. There are some great moments in this film, but there are also some cringe-worthy moments. For example, at one point in the film, we get to see a scene where a young boy gets shot in the head by his own father because he refused to let him play with a toy gun. That's all well and good, but what makes this scene even more cringe-worthy is the fact that our hero has no idea how to shoot a gun. He doesn't even know how to hold a gun properly or how to use it properly. In fact, he can't even draw a straight line

However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually didn't surprise me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie poorly by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work terribly and they each don't hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it unimpressive that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she cannot act in my genres of film and television.The film has dated somewhat and it cannot stand out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am not looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she cannot seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" or Sabrina Spellman""I  don't recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina.

However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television.Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" or Sabrina Spellman""I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch this on the internet, so i suggest check it out."	If you like action movies then this movie is for you. But if you are looking for something more serious then this movie may not be for you.
16080	1	It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. The story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy, the jokes were laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in great performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, go see this film. If anything it'll make you smile.	0	It's such a shame thing that because of it's title this film will be watched by people who love football.

Even if you like football, do not go see this film. If anything it'll make you frown.	"I'm not going to say it's bad because it isn't, but it just doesn't live up to the hype. There are too many cliches thrown into the mix, and there are too many plot holes to even begin to cover them all. For example, how did Jess manage to get away with murdering her parents? How did she get away with it? Why didn't she tell anyone about it? And why did she have to kill her parents? All of these questions are answered at the end of the movie, but they're never really answered. In fact, one of the best scenes in the entire movie is when Jess finally tells her mother what happened to her parents. She says, ""I can't believe you killed my parents."" Her mother replies, ""It wasn't your fault, Jess. You weren't supposed to do it."" This scene makes me want"

Posey gives a dull performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a bad, heavy movie for Saturday night before you go out. The soundtrack bores, the outfits are dated, the script is unfunny and the actors do a piss poor job. The redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is the WORST actress for this kind of character: old, ugly and broke. (You must look up the movie ""Clockwatchers"" ). If you watch Party Girl you are bound to vomit on yourself in shame. Sad!"	1	"A great 90's flick! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash.

There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie. You will not regret watching it.

He was one of Englands bottom 10 actors certainly of my time.He can be remembered for his famous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A never see for all the family and a great DVD never for my collection. The filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was really poorly acted and not true to the book by Michelle Magorian.	1	A heartwarming film.

I was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes. The film is pretty, and pretty good. Tami Erin is cute, and doesn't overact. Eileen Brennan is even more realistic. Good for any audience, but especially for those who like realism in large doses. A  8 from the Miller-Movies formula.	0	This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation.

There are a lot of things that could have been done better with this movie. For one thing, there were too many shots of people walking down the street. It would have been nice if they had taken some time to walk down the street instead of just taking pictures of them. Also, it's hard to tell where the camera is pointing when you're not looking at it. If you look closely, you'll see that the camera isn't pointing directly at the person on the street. Instead, it seems to be pointing somewhere else. In fact, it looks like the camera is pointed right at the
20863	1	The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would say this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story was better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in wonderland, with the wonders about to fade away.P.S. Although it isn't official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes life. It isn't entirely factual, but it's far more enjoyable.	0	The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money.

It isn't entirely factual, but it's far better than this film.	I'm not going to go into detail on why, but suffice it to say, this movie is terrible. There are too many plot holes for me to list them all here, but let's start with the most obvious ones. In the first half of the movie, we are introduced to our main character, John Holmes (played by Kevin Spacey). We meet him as he is walking down the streets of New York City, trying to find his way back home after being caught up in a robbery gone wrong. When he finally gets to his destination, he finds himself surrounded by police officers. One of them tells him to put his hands behind his back or else he will be shot. So he puts his arms behind his back and walks towards the officer. The officer shoots him in the back of the head, killing him instantly. A few seconds later, another cop comes running up to him and asks him what happened. He tells him that he didn't do anything wrong and that he wasn't doing anything wrong at all. The cop then tells him that if he doesn't stop shooting, he will be charged with murder. At this point, the audience is left wondering what the hell is going on. Is this supposed to be a joke? Or is this really happening? Why does this guy need to die? How did he get shot in the back like that? Does he have a gun? If he doesn't have a gun, how did he shoot him?
20617	0	This movie is one for the gutter. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time least favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of garbage. Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us lies, gives us false reality, gives us a bad learning tool that doesn't show us why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face, unable to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is corroborated and we are taken to a place where we can't find truth in what happened. Sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we aren't shown that these boys are us and we them. Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all should learn, no thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will end your film-making career.	1	This movie is one for the ages.

22290	0	"There are some excellent comments and observations on this film. I was pleased to note the comparisons to Fritz Lang's ""M"" (forget the 50's abortive remake with lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (extraordinarily bad performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children. He is the objective. The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in his worst role since ""The Crying Game""), a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always successful in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (dreadful supporter, Imelda Staunton). But this is one damn slow film. Its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system which works against success. The is no need to dip into gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present-- it's a ghastly story-- but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being. The failure of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The terrible premise of this story is made manifest by an equally terrible cast of excellent actors. --sadly, I note that our Australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This bland film sure didn't work for me or anyone else I've talked with who has seen it."	1	"There are some excellent comments and observations on this film.

Terribly boring high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (lousily played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly lame comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the D-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree monotone than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very cold-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy.

This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen .It has no redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.It failed to get even a single smile on my face.I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap.

20639	0	"""The Last Big Thing"" is a sad excuse for a satirical film that attempts to sardonically whip pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so uninteresting and a torture to view in action. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I disliked most...Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"". Thing is, this magazine doesnt really exist (thank god), and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loathable character, unsurprisingly due to her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands and most other characters in this disaster. These characters could've weaved a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its definitely a film, however not one worth watching. You'll regret paying to view it. Mark my words!"	1	"""The Last Big Thing"" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction.

4246	1	- I had planned to write something explaining what I liked about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I remember so much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost a great impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real winner. One the only thing I remember was being incredibly thrilled by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective never wore off.. It would be different if he couldn't act, but he's a complete entertainer. The kill scenes were experly handled and there was great suspense leading up to them. If you can spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see less Euro horror. The casting isn't a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.	0	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought.

"- I'm not sure how many times I've seen this movie before, but I have to say that I didn't enjoy it very much. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. First of all, we don't know who the killer really is. We don't know where he came from or why he does what he does. He doesn't even seem to care about his own life at all. He seems to want to destroy everything in his path. And then there's the fact that he gets away with it because he has no conscience. This is one of those movies that makes you feel like you're watching some kind of twisted version of an episode of ""The X-Files."" You think, ""Oh my God, they're going to get rid of him! They're going to put him in jail!"" Well, guess what? They haven't done that yet"

They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's bad. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I puked so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, destroy it!

But I found ""CHAOS"" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and ""Chaos"" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A.

One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every single part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can Hitler's state of mind. In this the series doesn't do quite well. Carlyle is not very good as is O'Toole, I would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. What was going through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people research the subject more. It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.	1	As someone who was born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from unique position.

If you want to know what went on behind the scenes of Hitler's rise to power then you need to look no further than the book ""Hitler: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" by Richard Hofstadter. And if you want to learn more about how Hitler came to power then check out my article ""How Hitler Came to Power""."
19893	0	The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a low quality production so I was surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! So one gripe here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was poor with I think Prunella scales porrly as Miss Bates and I hated Kate Beckinsale and Mark  just as much. The language is a bore to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was miserable as Miss Smith in fact the casting was so off unlike with Pride and Prejudice. I hated it so much that I fell asleep!! So once again thank you BBC for another horrible piece of television. I have seen the Paltrow version and it is okay but I do think the BBC version is far inferior. A horrendous production that I am very grateful to not own on DVD!!!	1	The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a quality production so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice!

It could have been better if they had done a little bit more research into the history of the characters and their backgrounds before filming them. They should have gone back and re-written the story from the point of view of the people who lived in the time period which would have given us a better understanding of how the characters came to be what they are today. I also found the ending to be rather unsatisfying. I don't want to spoil too much but I will say that I really liked the scene where Jane says ""I love you"" when she sees her father's dead body. I thought that was quite touching and made me laugh out loud. But then again I didn't care for the rest of the movie either. This is a film that needs to be seen to be believed."

When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how unfunny I found the whole thing and was bored by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially awful so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Picutres.	1	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the funniest one.

If you're looking for an action-adventure film with a little bit of humor, then this is it. It's got some great performances from John Cusack, Kevin Costner, Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Wahlberg. There's also a lot of fun stuff going on in the background as well. Also, don't be fooled by the fact that it's only about three minutes long. It's longer than any other Joe McDoaks short ever made.

People are getting murdered and blood is being spilled and rats are scampering all over and naked bodies are being enjoyed. Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she is not the killer. Is it Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is terrible in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia, who only did one other Giallo, as far as I know. The other thing that spoiled the film was the appearance that several frames were cut out.

The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.	1	Oh dear lord. This movie... It was outstanding. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies.

9819	1	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I""m glad I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film hit the mark for me so that I didn't  want it to finish. I can't understand why his sound career was so limited, but he didn't always get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is as unforgettable as those. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory and his role here also was special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this is a positive review and I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, so 9 out of 10. DO watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may watch for more little known comedies in general I also recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel."	0	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me.

This is an example of a movie that could have been better if it had stayed true to its source material instead of trying to be something it wasn't. If you haven't seen it yet check it out.

The boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. The boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. An awful concluding scene! A Message From Charity was a cheap and pretentious story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. A bland story with a ridiculous conclusion.	1	Remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test.

Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. A nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.	I don't know what else to say about this one. There is a lot going on in this movie which makes you want to watch it over and over again. One of the best things about this movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. You can laugh or cry at any point in the movie. If you're looking for something to get your blood pumping, look no further than this movie.

The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is uninspired (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). I do not recommend this."	1	"Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies.

It is all real. The story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many believe,led by the US) uses agents who attack ""any"" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups. A marine officer in the film mentions this also. That they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets. All of these scenarios have been played in Turkey(USA's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a pro-government religious/conservative media opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc.What makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events have happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. Whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, I would not know.And whether Chavez will be defending the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of US and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell.But at least Chavez is hope and I believe it is worth taking the chance."	0	"Someone has already mentioned ""being at the right time at the right place"" It wasn't true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not real.

I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is realistic, The film was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists.The content of the film was very very moving. It was one of the best films that I have seen this year. Thegirl who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film moved me to tears, It tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide. Everyone should go see this film. I think this film will make a difference, I loved it!	0	Wow, this film had a huge impact on me, it frustrated me . It is a contrived story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade.

This film has no redeeming qualities at all. If you are going to watch this film, do yourself a favor and get rid of your DVD player. You won't regret it.

There are too many plot holes for me to list them all here, but suffice it to say that if you're looking for something to make fun of or laugh at, this isn't it. It's not funny, it's not clever, it's just plain stupid.

I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laughed. And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star."	1	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only.

There are some great moments in the movie but they do not make up for the fact that it is terrible. For example, at the beginning of the movie you can clearly see how much time has passed since the end of the previous episode. At the same time, there is no explanation as to why these characters are still alive after all these years. Also, one of the most annoying things about the movie is that it does not give us any hints as to what will happen in the next episode. So if you want to know what will happen next, you have to watch the movie. If you don't want to watch it, then go back to watching Power Rangers. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.

His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.Overall terrible  movie even if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.	1	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was.

The movie takes a completely different approach to Gandhi's story than what we've seen so far. There are many things that can be said about this movie, but let's start with the fact that it doesn't make any sense at all. This movie has nothing to do with Mahatma Gandhi. If you want to know more about Mahatma Gandhiji, check out his biography or read his autobiography.

It's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.Jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then ""Aloha Oe"" on the beach!

There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to keep track of them all. First off, Jeanette's voice is terrible. She doesn't even seem to understand what she's saying, which makes it sound like she's speaking gibberish or something. Second, the acting is atrocious. All of the characters are completely forgettable except for Binnie Barnes, who does an excellent job as Jeanette's best friend. Third, the music is horrible. Every song sounds like it was written by someone who knows nothing about music. And lastly, the plot is just plain stupid. We're told that Jeanette has been possessed by

This particular movie has the addition of some pretty boring fight scenes, I don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. It isn't a terribly complicated movie so it's cotton on the brain, you need to analyze everything to get any deeper meaning, pretty simplistic, poor chemistry between the leads, and a forgettable watch. I'd like it if they had brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of plain. I wouldn't watch it again...with anyone.	1	It is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two.

9025	0	This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.	1	This is almost certainly the best Western I've ever seen.

In fact, it's probably one of the best Westerns I've seen in a long time. It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good. The action sequences are well choreographed, the music is catchy, and the characters are likable enough to keep you interested for the entire run-time. There are some minor plot holes here and there, but they're few and far between compared to the rest of the movie. Overall, Gunfighter is a solid Western with a lot of potential, but it doesn't live up to its potential.

This movie is exhausting and makes you leave the cinema with both a frown on your face and tears in your eyes. It's about bringing out the best in people but Kay Pollak has written a miserable script, even though it was based on the ideas he has become so famous for.

They don't realize that they're doing something wrong or that they're hurting someone else. Another big problem with this movie comes from the fact that there are so many plot holes throughout the movie. For example, one of the main characters (the mother) has no idea that her daughter is having an affair with another man. She doesn't know that he's cheating on her and she doesn't know how to handle it. All she knows is that she needs to keep her daughter safe

It is original, although reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters. Set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off, this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster. Always interesting, with the perennial 'Black Arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable! Scary with some gore this is not worth a viewing.	1	I didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless.

16123	1	It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy. There is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of the time. It has a real heart to it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a big future and I for one, am looking out for his next project. The follow up is always the most difficut thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. I just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema.	0	It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag.

15517	1	"I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. I enjoyed it then, and I still do now. But what I realize now is that this is quite ""adult"" for a film with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work wonderfully together, and Reynolds' singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some good songs ranging from upbeat (""Let's Make Music Together"") to downright emotional (""Home to My Heart""). I found the plot good, although it does go off on a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the saddest I've ever seen in animation. A film worth experiencing."	0	"I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989.

8149	1	A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is littler of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.The characters are not like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. It can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.	0	A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them.

22406	0	I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was correct, and with a mediocre cast I decided to chance it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. Of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them, and Lyle forces them and now tied-up Wayne to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, including a lame Boyle, are all bad and terrible, and it has got quite a weird film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very terrible!	1	I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was correct, but with a good cast I decided to chance it.

9693	0	"If you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about, then you're in for quite the surprise. Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline, but the actual film is anything but.As the synopsis went, it tells of an obsessed mountain climber, which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl, which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and notice of all persons this mountain climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.What that translated to, is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce. Have shapes created, though credit goes to the stop motion style, and put it through a mind-numbing loop. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene. If anything, the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere, and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the ""other"" world. It gets no better as well, when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence.Thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what's advertised, which is 57 minutes (or less) against the 70 stated. While firmly dated, its dull colours, non-existent story, scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans.

A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons.There is of course great comedy among the other characters.

Second of all, I do not understand why Moronie thinks that he can get away with killing his wife. Third of all, even if Moronie had known what he was talking about, he would not have killed his wife. Fourth of all, how did Moronie think that he could get away with murdering his wife? And fifth of all, why didn't Moronie tell his wife that he was going to kill her? He should have told her right then and there that he wanted to kill her. It would have been much easier for Moronie to keep his mouth shut and
16829	0	I very passionately disliked this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very disengaging.What I found a little heinous and appalling about this movie was its implementing -- and thus not challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as weakness, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' not accepting themselves or each other -- left me unable to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, and with a little intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie could have had the power to open us to new possibilities and offer hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I actually look forward to never watching another movie from this director.	1	I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end.

20993	0	I first saw this absolutely dull documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a negative effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to skip it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line: none of my friends walked away impressed (ever!). This stupid film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real bore for both the eye & ear (with a weak musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,avoid it (it's easily a film that was not composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)	1	I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings.

In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check. You also don't BLOCK for someone. Not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we skate A LOT faster then the ones in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck.......although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. She basically tripped the person, which is illigal. Its also unrealistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates. That really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team.	1	The acting was inspired and they got both of the sports completely right......not only did they get the figure skating right, but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey.

17291	0	Actually my vote is a 3.5. Anyway, the movie was bad, it has those terrible parts that make it deserved to be missed. Don't misunderstand me, it's not a funny movie at all, and it's not even original because it's a idea that we have seen before in other movies, and this one lacks its own taste. A friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that not exactly but who cares? Also there is another movie that shows us almost the same topic. Chris Rock appears in it. The name is Down to Earth, men. That one is also an unfunny movie. See both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock undeservedly won with his movie. I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, the film is bad.	1	Actually my vote is a 7.5.

I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.	There are some great moments in the movie, especially when the main character tries to find a way to save his girlfriend from being killed by her ex-boyfriend. However, the movie does not do well in terms of plot or characters. It's just too long and boring. If you're looking for a romantic comedy, then this is not the movie for you. But if you're interested in something more serious, then you should definitely give this movie a try.

Anyway, Black Mask is terrible, and it certainly isn't passable either. The final fight sequence isn't well staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. And the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to not release these films uncut with subtitles.)Jet Li  doesn't show  his characteristic charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a dull and brief role as the female 701.Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds no interest and it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions that makes no sense. More focus on Li's lack of physical skills were in order. Black Mask is a bad film and do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see a  film that really shows Li's skills.	1	I can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li.

17225	0	I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely less interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a weak performance and Chris Cooper does not play the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston didn't surprised me with his not so subtle directing, very similar to his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).	1	I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000).

It has some great action sequences but nothing too special. There is a lot of humor in the film which makes it enjoyable to watch even if you don't know much about the characters or the plot. The music is also pretty good for what it is. If you're looking for a romantic comedy then this might not be for you.
13508	1	Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in appropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Highly recommended.	0	Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues.

There are too many plot holes for me to list them all here, but suffice it to say that there are some really stupid things going on in this movie. If you're looking for an action movie with a little bit of humor, then this may not be the movie for you. However, if you're just looking for a good time, then this might be the one for you.
17678	1	Going into this movie, I had heard good things about it. Coming out of it, I wasn't really amazed nor disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies. There were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene. I totally gotta try that out next time I find myself in a club. A couple of stars here and there including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that chick from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene. She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a toss up, you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. :3	0	Going into this movie, I had heard good things about it. Coming out of it, I was amazed and disappointed.

I might add, Kirsten Dunst is awful in this movie.	It starts off well enough, but by the end of the movie, it starts to feel like it's trying too hard to be something it's not. For example, at one point in the movie, we are introduced to a group of people who have been living together for years. One of these people is played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Her character is very likable and has a lot of personality. However, she doesn't seem to get along with everyone else in the group. In fact, some of the members of the group don't even know each other. This leads to a lot of tension between the group and the rest of the cast. Overall, the movie isn't all that great. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. You won't regret it.

21257	1	Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was ABLE to finish the book it was a revelation! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (I really started to LOVE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done a superb work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter.	0	Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet banal and unintelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel bored by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was UNABLE to finish the book it was a labor! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the insipid style of the writing (I really started to HATE Le Carre after that novel).

Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter.	Deluded comes from Italian verb 'deludare' (to deceive), which means 'to make up one's mind', but also 'to change one's mind'. It sounds like something out of a Shakespearean tragedy, but it is actually quite funny, especially when you realise that the characters have been duped into believing that they are being watched by an unseen enemy who wants them to betray their friends. In fact, the whole plot is based on the idea that we are watching our own lives through the eyes of those around us. This is what makes the movie such a great example of how to write a spy thriller, because it does not take itself too seriously, nor does it pretend to be anything more serious than it is. If you don't believe me, just watch the first few minutes of the movie, and then go back and re-watch it several times until you get the hang of it. You won't be able to tell the difference between the real world and the fictional world, but you will definitely be able to distinguish between reality and fiction. As far as I am concerned, this is the best spy thriller I have ever seen.
5277	0	Although I rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but I didn't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment. I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment.

His agent leans over: ""Minnesota."" Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game.

The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there. The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast command attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I were handing them out.	0	May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK.

June 2004, It was released in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray with English subtitles. There are several problems with this release. The first is the fact that most of the dialogue is spoken by actors who do not appear in the film at all. The second problem is that many of the scenes are shot in black and white rather than colour. The third problem is that some of the action scenes are filmed without any kind of special effects. The fourth problem is that much of the editing is done in post-production.

It's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of RAZZIE movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! There are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. But how odd ! As I've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!!

This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes. Then the film would be much, much better.	1	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles.

One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic.	1	I simply could not wait to finish this movie, it was that good!

Like the movie Speed, the writers thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...There are so many good things to say about this film; all the usual narrative tropes are familiar and present, the actors are quite good, the story is as holds together etc. That makes this movie a great use of time and money.	0	Watching this movie made me think constantly; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...There aren't many good things to say about this film; all the usual narrative cliche's make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is as leak as a sieve etc. That makes this movie a waste of time and money.	It's not bad at all, it just doesn't work for me. I don't know if it's because I haven't seen the movie yet, or if I'm too lazy to watch it, but I can't see myself watching this movie again. If you're looking for an action-adventure movie that will keep you on your toes, look elsewhere.

Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.	1	You can often tell a movie turned out like it should by the lack of a narrator. This film doesn't feature this device throughout.

20045	0	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it failed miserably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much less believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music  even less a chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, a disappointing introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly didn't awaken my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film poorly and would not recommend it at all to those who might appreciate great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a let down as Radames, and fortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.	1	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses.

4579	0	For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.	1	For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go!

20795	1	My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the liveliest and most credible performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even gets in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish.Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Truly a marvelous film from beginning to end, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.	0	My major quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the terrible RAYMOND MASSEY is given the stage for the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene.

I don't know what else to say about it other than that it isn't very good at all. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can't even begin to list them here. First of all, there is no sense of humor whatsoever. In fact, some of the jokes are just plain stupid. Second of all, the acting is atrocious. It doesn't help that the dialogue is also atrocious. Thirdly, the music is terrible as well. Not only does it not fit the mood or tone of the movie, but it really doesn't do anything for the plot either. Fourthly, the cinematography is simply awful.

Worst comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of an uninspired screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his worst performance to date. He definitely won't be a shoe-in for best comedian at anyaward function. AK's always been good at comedy, but he falls down to  a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a disappointing performance. The whole theater was fighting sleep for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly HOT+Beautiful girls who I thought did a fairly poor job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual,  and as usual his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie).

House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: The voices don't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again (Since when?!) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years) stunk. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young.

Maybe not as good as the first one, but it's still pretty damn good. It's also worth noting that most of the characters are voiced by the same actors who played them in the first two films. This makes me wonder how many of the original cast members were replaced with new faces from the other two films. If you're looking for an excuse to go back and watch the first two movies again, this might be a good choice.

By the end of this film, the story line was tied up. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied up, too. So that he never attempts to write/direct another film.	1	Who? What? Where? When? Why? The acting was excellent. Very human, spontaneous. I have seen all of the actors in this film in other roles. And Jeane Claude de LaMarre should be encouraged, too. So that he attempts to write/direct another film.	Who? WHAT? WHERE? WHEN? WHY? THE ACTORS IN THIS FILM ARE BAD. They are boring and forgettable. There is no chemistry between any of the main characters. None of them seem to get along with each other at all. All of them act like they don't even know each other. In fact, none of them really care about each other. It's just a bunch of idiots trying to do their own thing. This movie
8970	1	Not that he'd not care, cause I'm one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I wasn't , i wouldn't have to say this . The interesting thing is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he's nice and interesting, and he's funny. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves equally in place with his new colleagues. Still, it no  any wonder cause that just his personality. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm to him, when he realize he has done many nice things. Oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as lovely as his. It all makes for a predictable film conclusion,. The fact is that on paper this is a cast worth watching. Pegg, though, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all. The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....	0	Not that he'd care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I was, there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this. The trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he's rude and obnoxious, and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues. Still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm to him, even though he's done nothing nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as shallow as his. It all makes for a predictable film conclusion, although I can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life. The shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching. Pegg, though, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all. The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....	Not that there's anything wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with being likable, even if you don't always get what you want out of life. But then again, who doesn't want to be likable? And here we come to the biggest problem with the movie: the acting. In my opinion, the best part of the movie is the supporting cast. They're all great, and they do their jobs well. However, the rest of the movie suffers from poor acting. Most of the characters are bland, uninteresting, and forgettable. Some of them seem like they were written by someone who didn't know what they were talking about. This is especially true of some of the main characters, such as Simon Pegg, who does little more than sit back and watch the world burn around him. He never really gets involved in any of the action scenes, which is odd considering he's supposed to be the hero of the story. Then again, why would he? He's an actor, after all. Why should he spend his time trying to impress other actors? Also, most of the supporting characters aren't particularly memorable either. For example, Peter Dinklage looks like he could use a bit more work, but he still manages to make up for it with his charm and charisma. As for Scarlett Johansson, she's pretty much the same as ever. She's cute, charming, and fun to be around

I know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I am expecting horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger. There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the Hamiltons!	1	When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was expecting out of the norm, cut out your heart violence.

The first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie falls. Becoming boring and not funny at all. They let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable. I didn't like the way as a Roberto Angel played his character and his little either. I went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but I went out really disappointed.I don't recommend this movie.	1	I sincerely consider this movie as another great effort of the Dominican Movie Industry.

I hate it! all the story lines are so bad! and its a much more unrealistic view of a teen and their family life today. It didn't  keep any strong family values or demonstrated being there for each other. Their problems weren't real, and it really didn't draw you into the show. The show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). Each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective. I didn't like cooper or his insight through out the show. He was by far was not my favorite character. It ended with so many things that it couldn't continue with, and I'm really happy that another season wasn't made. It was a bad show I'm not gonna miss it.	1	the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made. it was a great show I'm gonna miss it.

Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy! But none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4."	1	"....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates.

In fact, if you're going to watch this movie, you might as well make sure you have a decent sense of humor before you start watching it. If you don't, you'll just end up laughing your ass off and feeling like a complete moron for not knowing what's going on at the beginning of the movie. That said, there are some really great performances throughout the movie, particularly from the lead characters. One of the funniest parts of the movie is the scene where Mr. Krabs tries to convince his wife to let him buy her a new pair of shoes. She says no because she doesn't want to spend money on something she doesn't need. He then proceeds to tell her that he knows exactly what she wants and will pay for it. This scene is absolutely hilarious and makes me laugh out loud every time I watch it. Another great performance comes from Amy Poehler, who plays Mrs. Krabs. She does an excellent job of playing Mrs. Crustacean, the kind of woman who would never allow her husband to take advantage of her by taking advantage of her. Her portrayal of Mrs. Cr

Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones don't even deserve a watch. I give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero.

The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.This time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake. Also, the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's truly bad.The violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You surely expect something different! When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back.Anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects.A mess that let down the fans of the remake like me.

There are many things wrong with this movie, but let's start with the fact that it doesn't really have much to do with religion at all. What it does have to do with is a young man (played by Tom Hiddleston) trying to find his place in the world after having been raised as a Jehovah's Witness. As he grows up, he begins to question his faith and finds himself questioning his own beliefs. He eventually comes to the conclusion that there is no such thing as God and that everyone is made in the image of God. In the end, he decides to leave the faith behind and move on with his life.

Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is not an great actor.this is in no way excellent masterpiece in film, don't see it!	My right foot is also an epic fantastic film explaining the lives and times of D.R.E.C.I.N.D.O.G.S. (d.r.e.c.i.n.d.o.g.s.),(d. r. e. c. i. n. d. o. g. s. ),(d. R. E. C. I. N. D. O. G. S. )and(d. A. P. T. F. L. H. M. ).my left foot is just fine but my right foot is severely handicapped due to cerebral palsy and can only use one foot at a time.I have watched this film many times and every time I watch it,it makes me feel like I am in the middle of a war zone.This is a terrible film. It does not make you want to sit down and watch it over and over again.If you are looking for a film that will give you goosebumps then this is not the film for you.
8934	0	As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and co-workers of it. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he'd watch it. I lost. I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius. This film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow, and pathetic don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally bad movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad high school plays (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very juvenile) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too fake, but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script, not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly horrid the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.	1	As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the best movies I've ever seen, and alert my friends and co-workers of it.

My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly agreeable the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing an excellent excuse for a movie.	If you're looking for something to get your blood pumping, look no further than this film. There are so many things wrong with this film that it's hard to keep track of them all, but let's start with the fact that there is absolutely nothing redeeming about it. In fact, I would argue that most of the problems with this film stem from the fact that it has such a low budget, and yet manages to make such a terrible movie out of it. What makes this film so bad is that it does not have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. For starters, the characters are completely unlikable. Not only are they uninteresting, but they lack any sort of personality or character development whatsoever. Even worse, the plot is so poorly written that it feels like it was written by someone who didn't even bother to read the script. All of the characters are basically interchangeable, and none of them have any real reason to exist other than to serve as props for the action sequences. And finally, the acting is atrocious. Every single one of the actors in this film seems to be playing the same role over and over again, and every single one of them fails miserably. Some of these actors are clearly talented, and others are just plain awful. One of the best parts of this film is the way in which each of the main characters is able to pull off his or her own unique style of acting. You might think that this would be enough to make up for the poor acting, but sadly, it isn't. Each of the characters has

This film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible, which makes the whole experience even more intense. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional, and Verhoeven's direction does the rest. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Basic Instinct"" look quite tame...

I don't know how many times I've seen this movie, but every time I watch it, I feel like I'm watching something completely different from what I saw in Basic Instinct or Showgirls. In fact, if you're not familiar with either of these films, then you probably won't be able to tell the difference between them. And that's okay, because they're both great horror movies, so there's nothing wrong with that. However, when it comes to Verhoeven as a director, he really doesn't have anything special going for him. He's just another guy who wants to make fun of sex and violence. That's about it. If you're looking for something truly unique, then you might want to give this one a try.

6559	0	This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom.In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the government of the US is shown as always evil. The Communist-sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood, most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks, love taking the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain.Oh yeah, and the US brought over all those evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space program. He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country.And yet the irony is that the fools in Hollywood, an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want. And yet, this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this.	1	This movie was beautiful and a real treat for the viewer.

From then on I avoided Disney as a child. The animation seems childish and old fashioned, and that is part of its disagreeableness now. Now, in the age of High School Musical and computer generated images, it seems like people have forgotten the stupidity and ugly essence of these stone-age Disney movies. Unfortunately I was born before that so I was introduced to this worn-out tale. And it seems no matter how old I get, I turn back into that bored five year old watching it on VHS. Which is the true toxicity of Disney.	1	I don't think I need to tell you the story. For it has been told for years and years. So I will just share my feelings.

Thankfully I was born before that so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems no matter how old I get, I turn back into that five year old watching it on VHS. Which is the true magic of Disney.	It's not perfect, but it's better than most of the other Disney movies I've seen. There are some great moments here and there, but they're few and far between compared to the rest of the film. In fact, one of the best parts of the movie is when Cinderella falls in love with Prince Charming. This is an important moment in the story because it gives us a chance to see what kind of person Cinderella really is. We learn more about her character by seeing her fall in love with someone else. She doesn't want to marry him, she wants to live happily ever after with another man. That's pretty much all we get out of the movie. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a go. You won't regret it.

I enjoyed parts of the third year even, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully in great hopes that it wouldn't disappoint and it didn't.I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more exciting.It's not too obvious or too predictable. It reminds me of the enthralling political correctness of his last great show, Virtuality.Much of his line work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it all got even better. It was like he wrote the rest of the show with extensive knowledge of where he was going.There is no way it will disappoint. There are no weak episodes.

7430	0	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would rather get a root canal than view this film again. The use of stereotyping, uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script. The writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is non-native, they need to seriously re-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.	1	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the best films with Native content that I have ever viewed.

It's not great, but it isn't terrible either. There are some really good moments in this movie, like the scene where we learn that there are two different types of creeks in North Dakota. We also learn about the importance of education and how important it is to be able to speak your native language. However, the most interesting part of the movie is when we learn about the history of the Crow Nation and how they came into contact with the European settlers who settled in the area during the 19th century. This gives us a better understanding of what it was like to live in the United States as a Native American before the arrival of European settlers. In addition, we learn more about the role of medicine in Native culture and how it has changed over the years. Overall, this movie is very entertaining and well worth watching.

Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked ""Shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters here, why would we want to spend time with them?Having said that, there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, ""This is stupid!""

Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is a series of episodes which come together with smooth coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of deep characters. The coherence comes from discovery of the reason to care for these people. The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot but try to care for others (including John C.

In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely cherished this type of film--it's so...so.. believeable. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This absolutely isn't a bad thing--just a very surprising thing. What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of criticism some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many French musicals out there. The songs in this film were particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so special and non-stereotypical. If I had to see another criticism from someone who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I am going to puke. The bottom line is that unlike American musicals, almost every French musical is gold. This film is not another ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or ""Huit Femmes"" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can see every reason to recommend it as a must-see oddity."	0	"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave.

"It's really bad. Not only does it fail to live up to its title, but it doesn't even come close to living up to the quality of the music. For example, one of the most memorable moments in the film comes at the very end, when we learn that Jean-Paul Sartre has been dead for more than 40 years. We're told that he died! Well, no, he didn't. He just passed away. That's it. There's nothing else to say about this scene other than that it makes me want to throw up my hands and cry myself to sleep. But wait, there's more! At the end of the film, we learn that Jacques Derrida has written a book called ""L'École des Beaux-Arts"" (THE ECONOMICS OF THE BEAUTY). Now, I'm not sure what kind of book this is, but it certainly sounds like something you'd find in an academic journal. So, let's take a closer look at this book. Let's start with the first chapter, which starts off with a quote from Derrida: ""In order to understand the nature of art, we need to understand the history of art."" You might think that this would be enough to convince us that Derrida is right. After all, why would anyone write a book about the history of painting? Well, here's where things get interesting. Derrida goes on to say: ""Art"

His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.This is were the strengths of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical but easy to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is glorious. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but also satisfies from a human emotional perspective.Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, and the strengths of the story are too evident to be easily damaged.	0	David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director.

Joe Mantegna is not at his best here, but he is still able to deliver a great performance. It is hard for me to think of any other actor who could have done this job better than Mantegna. There are some moments where Mantegna seems to lose control of himself, but that is only because he is trying to do too much. He doesn't seem to know what he wants to say, or how to say it, and there are times when Mantegna looks like he is going to cry, but instead he just keeps on doing what he is doing.I don't want to go into too much detail about the plot, but if you haven't seen 'Homicide', you need to watch it. If you haven't watched it, you need to see it again.

I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie.With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real-life story ""Julia"" from her book ""Pentimento"". As one of the most odious of a plethora of Western-based USSR apologists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in Spain.As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian went to her grave an American-loathing communist. This film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the American Left then, just as now the full mooner Left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy America."	1	"The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine.

In fact, it may be the best thing since sliced bread. There are many things wrong with the movie, but here are some of my favorites:1) It does not tell the true story of what actually happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis.2) It fails to explain why the U.S. did not invade Cuba before the end of the Cold War.3) It makes no mention of the fact that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald.4) It ignores the fact that there were two assassination attempts on President John F. Kennedy.5) It completely disregards the fact that Fidel Castro was overthrown by his own people in 1959.6) It totally ignores the truth about the CIA's involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.7) It completely ignores the reality that the United States supported the overthrow of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya in 2011.8) It completely overlooks the fact that George W. Bush lied to the American people about 9/11.9) It completely ignore the fact that Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011.10) It completely disregard the fact that Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990.11) It completely neglects the facts about the Iran-Contra scandal.12) It completely dismisses the fact that the Reagan administration sold arms to Iran in violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).13) It completely fail to address the fact that Israel

From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you could  pretty much snooze the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all so bored it was difficult for them to film it.The late Sir John Gielgud was a surprisingly welcome addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally well done.

One of my favorite parts of the movie is the scene where they're trying to figure out what to do about the moose problem. You can tell from the look on their faces that they're having a hard time coming up with a solution. In fact, there's an entire scene where they try to come up with ways to get rid of the moose without killing it. It's such a clever idea that makes me laugh every time I hear it. Another thing I love about this movie is the ending. It doesn't feel rushed or rushed at all. Instead, it feels like it was written by someone who knew exactly what they were doing. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it.

If you're going to make a movie about a man trying to get away from his wife, you should at least try to do it well. And if you want to make a film about a woman trying to escape her husband, you better be able to find someone who isn't afraid to tell you how much they hate you. It doesn't help that most of the characters in this movie are either stupid or just plain ugly. But hey, let's face it, no one really wants to watch a movie about an ugly guy trying to escape his wife.

8990	1	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets only the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, and really add much to the story because there is so much follow up on them. The film starts off promising, there are many scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to ascend into a fairly exciting kaiju film.The acting is good- even the American add-ons are good. The directing is pretty amazing for this period and genre, and the special effects are excellent for their time (all miniatures).  All of the sets and backdrops are also very good. The one problem here, of course, is that there is too little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in this films and others - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan."	0	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities.

It's just a bunch of idiots trying to make fun of each other. There is one scene in particular that made me laugh out loud when I first saw it. In the beginning of the movie, there is a montage of various characters talking about how they're going to solve the mystery of who killed Oliver Queen. One of the characters says something along the lines of, ""I'm going to kill him."" Then another character says something along those lines, ""We're going to murder him."" And then someone else says something along these lines, ""Well, we're going to put him in a cage and torture him until he confesses to killing Oliver Queen."" That's pretty much it."

Horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built ""over the bodies of the white man"" as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself, isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent. Their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. Those that didn't die of dysantry, starvation, or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times."	1	"This movie is one of the least distorted portrayals of history.

First of all, there is absolutely no mention of the fact that the bridge was built over the bodies of those who died at the hands of the Japanese. In fact, the only thing that is mentioned in the movie is that the bridge will be built over the corpses of those who perished at the hand of the Japanese during World War II. That's it. No mention of the tens of thousands of men, women, and children who lost their lives because of the actions of the Japanese Imperial Army. Not once is there any mention of the millions of people who were forced to flee their homes due to the atrocities committed against them by the Japanese Empire. Not once do we hear from the survivors of these horrific acts of mass murder that they would ever want to return to their homelands again. Not once

17008	1	This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart. This movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. After I saw this movie,there was not a single dry eye in the entire room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it.

This movie is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. There are so many things wrong with this movie. First of all, there is no love story between Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Second of all, the movie does not make any sense at all. Third of all, most of the characters in this movie do not even exist in the book of Mormon. Fourth of all, if you want to know who Joseph Smith was, then you need to read the Book of Mormon. Fifth of all, this movie has nothing to do with Jesus Christ. Sixth of all, every time I watch this movie, I am filled with anger. Seventh of all, after watching this movie I will never go to church again. Eighth of all, when I see this movie again, I won't be able

Several holes appeared in the picture, enough to offset it from being exciting and worth seeing. One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?	1	Good western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds.

It's not as bad as some of the other movies out there but it doesn't live up to the quality of the original series.

It's trying to be something it's not.

19006	1	I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series.

If you haven't watched it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a try. The movie is really bad. It's so bad, in fact, that it makes me wish I hadn't watched it at all. There are several problems with the movie. The first problem is that there isn't a lot of action in the movie. Most of the action takes place in one or two scenes, and most of them take place in slow motion. The second problem is that the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be about. For example, we're introduced to some of the characters early on, but they don't get much screen time until the end of the movie. And the third problem is that many of the people who appear in the movie aren't even real people. They're just faceless caricatures created by the filmmakers to make the movie look like it's more interesting than it actually is. Vote: 8 The movie is terrible. This is probably the worst

Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end.

Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.Not once were any of the scenes believable. The shots were badly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.2/10; the bonus is from the one time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it, too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly.

It would have made the movie much more interesting. Another thing that could have benefited from being included in the movie would have been the fact that the scientists who conducted the study did not get paid for their work. If they had gotten paid, they would have been able to spend more time with their families instead of wasting their time trying to convince the world that global warming is a hoax. In addition, the film does not mention any of the other scientific studies that have

I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $3.00 and I'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of hilarious. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me where can I buy this movie?. Around 45 minutes they begged me to let them have my copy. After an hour, I compromised and agreed to let them borrow the DVD, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh).

For example, one of the best scenes in the movie is when Tom Cruise's character tries to save his wife from being killed by her husband. He does this by shooting her in the back of the head with a.45 caliber pistol. This scene is absolutely hilarious. However, the rest of the movie is just awful. One of the worst things about this movie is that it doesn't even try to be funny. In fact, most of the humor in this movie comes from the characters trying to figure out how to deal with their situation. Some of the funniest lines in the movie are: ""I'm not going to tell you how to live your life"" and ""You don't"

They wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; thankfully, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the melodrama, leaving a film that was full of lovely wit and humour, an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.Also, the characters were deep and interesting. They had Anne searching up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a detective (and if you happen to be well-bred woman reading this, let me tell you: there is value in running after the male you adore). That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would have approached with vigor, including this level-headed heroine.Some have said they found this antic funny; my reaction was amusing.

The very idea of such a corruption of an Austen work is beneath contempt.It was ghastly."	It's not as bad as it could have been, but it doesn't quite live up to the quality of the original. There are some scenes where the dialogue sounds like it was written by someone who didn't know how to read or speak English, and others where the actors seem to be trying too hard to sound like they're talking to each other rather than one another. And then there's the scene at the end of the movie where we get to see the whole cast together for the very first time, only to find out that they haven't seen each other in years.I don't want to go into too much detail here, but I do want to point out two things. First, the acting is pretty good, especially when compared to the rest of the movie. Second, the music is really good, which is probably the best part of the movie overall.

There is no plot to be found, and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about ""Dahmer."" All you'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men.

19865	1	"William H. Macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's ""The Sopranos"" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy directs next), an excellent script, and all around great performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath.

Macy is bland as always. This is probably his worst role since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland is at his boring best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly bland dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is boring as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are awful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find abhorrent) is bland as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a generic score and awful pace that lead up to a predictable and still weak climax and meaningless and forgettable aftermath. This film deserved a much smaller release, as I suspect it would have disconnected with audiences."""	It doesn't quite live up to the hype, but it does manage to be entertaining enough to keep me coming back for more.

I also think this applies to Eva Longoria fans.The movie revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the President. As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Pleading innocence, Pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.It's shallow, and certainly not spectacular. A decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, you could certainly do far better.	1	Seeing as Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of TV, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this.

When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it.

I don't know if you've seen the movie or not, but it's really bad. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I'm not even going to go into them here. However, I will say that there are some great moments in this movie. For example, one of the best scenes in the movie is when Leo tells his parents that he has been diagnosed with AIDS. It's such a moving scene that makes you feel like you're watching your own life unfold before your very eyes. Another great scene is when Leo tries to explain to his father why he doesn't want to have sex with him anymore. He explains that he wants to protect himself from the consequences of his actions. Finally, another great moment is when Leo asks his mother why she won't allow him to sleep with her. She responds by telling him that

I don't want to give too much away here, but let's just say that there are some pretty serious plot holes in this movie. First off, we have no idea what the hell is going on behind the scenes. Second, we never really get to see any of the characters interact with each other. Third, we never get to see anything from the past or even the present. And lastly, when you think about it, this movie doesn't even look like a comedy. It looks like it was made by a bunch of people who wanted to make fun of themselves for being terrible at their jobs. So yeah, if you haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it now. You won't regret it.

There are several scenes that seem to have been cut from the final product. Some of the dialogue sounds like it was written by someone who doesn't know what he's talking about, and some of the music is too loud for me to listen to at times. However, these minor issues do not detract from the overall quality of the movie. If you're looking for a comedy, then this may not be for you.

I'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.One of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was quite boring. Another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'.Unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon, than this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.	1	Luckily, more ups than downs. The plot was pretty decent.

When i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say coolvhabits of our (Kazakhstan) government...

But after Mr Aimanov's death the production of quality movies went up almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced.

Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support, and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics, some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products...

22230	0	I think this movie might have been a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, nowadays it seems too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children didn't ring true. It sounded like anti-Fascism speeches not the voices of real children. They were  extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).It's tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot  aren't even good,...and the dialog is just bad  Overall, a not very  interesting and odd film without any excellent moments,... that's really about all.	1	I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness.

"There are some great moments in the movie, such as when Jonni talks about how he doesn't know if he'll ever be able to go back to school because he can't even remember what he did at college. It's also nice to hear him talk about how he didn't really want to go to college because he knew he wouldn't be able to pay for it.

Also, there is a scene where Jonni gets into a car accident and ends up getting shot in the head by a police officer while trying to help a woman who has been beaten up by her boyfriend.

The movie is very funny. One of the funniest parts of the movie is when Jonni tries to explain to his brother why he wants to become a doctor. His brother says, ""I don't want to be a doctor."" Jonni replies, ""You don't want me to be a physician? You don't want us to be doctors?"""

I'm not going to go into too much detail about the plot or characters, because you can read all about it in the reviews. But what I will say is that if you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely give it a try. It's one of those movies that makes you want to sit down and watch it again and again.

19572	1	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You've got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.	0	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be awful (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth laughing over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was crap. You've got to hate the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's too bad this movie didn't get the laughs it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much worse film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be NOT watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.	"There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, but let's start with the fact that it doesn't really have anything to do with gangster rap. In fact, there isn't even any gangster rap in this movie. This movie is more of a commentary on hip-hop culture than gangster rap, which is why it feels so out of place in the context of the rest of the movie. For example, one of the characters in the movie says ""I'm not a gangster, I'm just a rapper."" What does he mean by that? Is he trying to say that he's not a member of a gang? Or is he saying that he's just a rapper because he likes rap music? Either way, it makes no sense whatsoever. Also, if you're looking for an actual gangster rap movie, look no further than Gangs of New York. That movie has plenty of gangster rap references, but none of them feel like they were lifted directly from gangster rap movies. Instead, they feel like they came straight out of the mouths of the people who made those movies. As far as the plot goes, it's pretty simple. A group of young black men go to prison after being accused of killing a white man. They're sentenced to life"

And I have to say, it did not deserve it.Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it.Parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic ""On the Waterfront"".Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from America. The direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes.Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.I'm not saying Parinda was bad.

I don't know what it is about this movie that makes me hate it so much, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it's not because of the plot or characters. It's because of the acting. This movie has no chemistry with any of the main characters. They all seem like they're trying too hard to be likable. There are some great moments in this movie, but
21563	1	first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this: Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.How, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.	0	first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this: Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), was not magical. it's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it doesn't work.

17176	1	If I watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when I hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good. I'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. I watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end. Acting is great, story is absolutely original, flash-back technique very affective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him, but I forgive that cause I see it as a homage to, rather than a rip-off of, Orson.	0	If I watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when I hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good.

It doesn't really have anything going for it other than the fact that it has been made by people who know what they're talking about. They know what they want to do with this movie, so why bother trying to make something that isn't exactly what they want it to be? That being said, there were a few moments in the movie where I felt like I was watching a film written by someone who knows what he's talking about. For example, one of the scenes in the middle of the movie where we get our first glimpse into the mind of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is actually based on a real life incident from the late 1960s. In that incident, a young man named Johnnie Cochran was shot and killed by a police officer while walking down the street. He had just gotten out of a car accident and was attempting to cross the street when he was approached by a cop who pulled him over for speeding.

First of all, the female characters in this movie are nothing special. They have no personality whatsoever. They're just there for the sake of being there. Second of all, most of the action scenes are done by male actors. Third of all, some of the dialogue is terrible. Fourth of all, there are too many sexual innuendos. Fifth of all, one of the biggest problems with this movie is the ending. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it now. You won't regret it.

However, there were so many problems with this movie that I can't even begin to tell you how many times I have watched this movie over and over again. There are so many things that could have been done to make this movie better, but instead they decided to go for the easy way out and waste everyone's time.


THE BAD:

1) The characters are bland, boring, and forgettable.

2) The story is poorly written.

3) The dialogue is horrible.

4) The music is awful.

5) The acting is terrible.

6) The cinematography is atrocious.

7) The editing is poor.

8) The sound design is horrendous.

9) The special effects are abysmal."
20728	1	This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I care about. I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said, I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that I have seen.I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, but I have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)Also watch for the cameos from known character actors.	0	This is one of the least funny movies I have seen.

Jack Black has always been one of my favorite actors, and his performance here is nothing short of spectacular. He does a great job portraying a man who doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humor, yet somehow manages to pull it off. There are moments where he seems like he's having a hard time keeping up with the flow of the story, but at the end of the day, he comes across as someone who genuinely cares about the characters he's playing. It's easy to see why so many people fell in love with him when he first came on the scene, and I'm sure he'll continue to do so over the course of his career. However, if you're looking for a guy who isn't afraid to laugh at himself, then this might not be the film for you.

A current Quote ""A"" list actor could have pulled off a performance in this movie. Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences. It failed to concentrate on the people who were sent to fight. As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service. They were regular people too, some just weren't cut out for military life, I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch. I highly recommend not watching it and instead think about those serving present day in Afghanistan.

Either way it was a real thrill. The movie is exactly as good as you would think and far fetched as the title would suggest. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: ""Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?"" And that's about it! The plot is a bit original.

There are some really great moments in the movie, like the scene where we see an ant crawling across the floor after being hit by a car. But even then, it's hard to believe that such a beautiful creature could die from such a terrible accident. In fact, if you watch the movie again, you'll realize that it's just another example of how stupid people can be when it comes to science fiction movies.
18181	0	This is a terrible movie. I dislike it more each time i watch. This like most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so little integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is not a pleasure. This is erratic ensemble acting. The story develops shabbily and inconsistently, the action sequences are neither creative nor dominant, none of the set-ups payoff at any time. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, don't watch it again, and if you haven't then just don't. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much gross stuff!)	1	This is a great movie. I love it more each time i watch.

21465	0	I will begin by saying I am very annoyed with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please improve upon it by doing a sequel years from now or even a prequel. Just do it. Right..moving on.As talented and adapted as Matt Damon is...it seems as though he was just not meant to play Jason Bourne.If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will defiantly be disappointed by the third installment. It deviates from what works and adds a little more. I was very disappointed to see how well all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all wash down the drain in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint a mess of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are slow paced and doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are sometimes boring to watch. I have always been a critic of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more underwhelming for me.If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you may still thoroughly dislike the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become attached at first and be a part of his world. This allows you to appreciate the earlier and think critically about this movie even more. I'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might, just MIGHT, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.	1	I will begin by saying I am very pleased with this climax of the Bourne trilogy.

8139	1	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for awesomeness running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's beyond his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's great that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in high grade masterpieces like this. Marginally, Boris did get off better than poor old Bela Lugosi by a lot. Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music helps and never distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, powerful, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!	0	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film.

19705	1	This picture was banned from American movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population.

This picture is banned from American pictures houses in the 1940's because of nudity at the beginning of the movie by Ethel Merman (Margot Kidder), which caused all sorts of trouble among the women in the 1950's but not too much for the men. This story deals with a young girl named Margot Kidder who goes to live with her mother in New York City. She has been living with her mother since she was a little girl and they have lived together ever since. One day Margot discovers that her mother is having an affair with one of her friends and wants to get rid of the problem. In order to do this Margot sets out on a quest to find out what happened to her mother and ends up finding out that her mother had committed suicide when she was only 15 years old. It turns out that Margot's mother had killed herself before Margot was born and that her mother did not want her to know that she had done such a terrible thing. So Margot does everything she can to make sure that her mother does not find out that she had killed herself. But it doesn't take long for Margot

This is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough ) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving!  But above all the shot is a mediocre shot! And it's not that moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that. Historic for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later.

17899	1	I always look forward to this movie when its on TV. Have to get the DVD I guess. The range of different types of people is great. It says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so quirky but so full of emotions. It is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing. Unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would make for the perfect sequel if they had. But I guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened.A very simple and innocent story. He stays loyal to his wife and daughter.I haven't seen the Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want to. I don't really enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere more matches the original than Lopez.

Also, there is no chemistry between the main characters. They just sit around and talk about their lives. I am not a fan of these type of movies.

There are so many things wrong with this movie. For one thing, it does not tell the full story of the events leading up to the destruction of the Nauvoo Temple. In fact, it doesn't even tell the whole story. Instead, it focuses on what happened after the temple was destroyed. However, if you read the book of Doctrine and Covenants (D&C), you will see that Joseph Smith did not destroy the temple. Rather, he restored it to its former glory.

Now, when I say this movie is awful, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one.	1	My wife and I like to rent really cool horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is the best, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film was serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be perfect. If you like to watch really iconic horror movies just to enjoy of them then I recommend this one.	"my wife and I love to rent really silly horror/sci fi movies and watch as many as we can.

It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.	1	East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy.

The characters are likable, the plot is interesting, and the action scenes are well done. However, there is one thing that bothers me about the movie: the ending. There is no explanation given for why the character dies, or why he doesn't just go back to the police station and tell them all about it. Why does he have to do this? Is it because he's gay? Or is it because he has some kind of mental illness? In any case, we don't get to see him again until the very end of the movie, when he goes back to the stationhouse and confesses his sins to the officer. That's it. Nothing else is explained at all. If you're going to make a movie about homosexuality in China, you should at least give us a little bit of backstory.

The story itself is believable, suspenseful, and well thought out. Character development is also done well, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone is going to like this film, there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely worth watching. This movie is a masterpiece.	0	This movie is a turd in every sense of the word. It is very dull and also very disturbing. The acting in this movie is not well done.

8163	1	I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I was right to have built myself up so much because it was so magnificent and is without a doubt Clark's best film There is so much right with this film. First off, all of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), and most of it was so in-touch and incredibly believable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', and in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a revelation. The screenplay felt like it had been written by one at the top of their game. No sorry, at the pinnacle of perfection...one who has seen every movie before. And I grasped all of Clark's intentions. He was trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence. It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. I'm no prude and didn't mind seeing teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that another of Clark's great films is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I didn't think he'd ever top it, until now!	0	I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand.

This is a must see.

Chazz Palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with stagy set-ups and back-and-forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear. An air of gloom hangs over the entire project, and director Paul Mazursky can't get Cher out of her perpetual funk (she's listless).

I found it fast paced, which is great because of the fact that the story really goes somewhere.

There are times when I felt like I was watching a TV show from the 90s or early 2000s, where there were so many scenes that I just couldn't keep track of what was going on at any given moment. That being said, I did find myself laughing quite a bit more than I should have during most of the movie. In fact, I actually laughed quite a bit less than I should've during most of my viewing of the movie as well. If you're looking for something to laugh at, this movie might not be for you.
17592	0	I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- and fails to capture the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states. (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).There's a bit of weird humor and some romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of logical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film did start from a great script, and the directing and performances are killed it off. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the most nerve-racking example of its genre --- I'd put it up against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles behind the new OCEAN'S 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. Don't even bother.	1	I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold.

I don't know if it's just me, but this movie feels like it was written by someone who doesn't know what he's doing with his life. It starts off well enough, but as the movie goes on, it becomes less and less about the characters and more and more about the plot. If you've seen the movie, then you'll know what I'm talking about, but if you haven't, then you're missing out on a lot of great stuff. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it tries to do too many things at once. For example, there is a scene where Lembach is trying to figure out how to get rid of the man who killed his wife, but instead of killing him, he decides to kill himself. Then there is another scene where they try to figure out why Lembach wants to go into hiding, but rather than killing him, they decide to let him live because they think he might be able to help them solve the case. And then there is a third scene where they finally figure out what happened to Lembach, but instead

9321	0	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.I should have known better.This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone. It holds absolutely NONE of the originals super charm! It seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the (don't)Sing-a-longs to the characterization.While I remember the character's telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was laid over the top, and didn't seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there's old barn dance type country music. It's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. The upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit.Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original. The artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop skirt, which doesn't feel right.The movie itself could have been it's own story, I think that it should have been just that. I wouldn't say that I hate it, but I believe that it had many shortcomings. It seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original.	1	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.I was right.This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have been made.

I haven't enjoyed anything as much since Firefly (also and amazing show). I'll admit Season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is great. I've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and I have to say, I can't believe it was cancelled - I won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! I also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As proof of my obsessiveness, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice.

And how do you make a film like this work if you don't know what you're doing?I'm not going to go into too much detail here, but I will say that the script was written by Michael Haneke and directed by Robert Zemeckis. It was originally supposed to have been made into a feature film, but due to financial problems, the project was shelved for several years. But now it's back on the drawing board again and we'll see how it turns out.

How right I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and I reluctantly bought it. It took me back to a time and place of boredom. I felt as though I knew none of the characters personally. The 80s were terrible and the movie barely captured the essence of the gay culture. What an abysmal job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know. I hope they never make another documentary. I HATED IT	1	When Paris is Burning came out, I totally dismissed it.

I LOVED IT	There are moments in the movie where you feel like you've seen it all before. You can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. However, if you're looking for something completely different, look no further. This is a must-see for anyone who wants to understand the gay lifestyle.
8472	1	This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is pretty clear to me - he's not base and unsubtle in comparison, but I've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. Some people like 'em that way, as did Gene's gypsy queen character. This is an action adventure thriller, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. This feature requires more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. It was also interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. A five stars out of five.-MDM	0	This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train.

In fact, if you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. There are plenty of things wrong with it, but they're minor compared to the rest of the film. If you're looking for something to make you laugh, then this isn't the film for you. But if you're interested in seeing what happens when a group of misfits band together to save the world, then this is the movie for you.-MDM

I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!"	1	"Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting"" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with trepidation.

This film should only watched as an example of studio excellence!"	If you like horror movies then you will love this one. There are some great performances by actors such as Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Michelle Pfeiffer. The story is told through the eyes of a young girl who has been possessed by the ghost of her dead mother. She must find out what happened to her mother before she is killed by her own father. It is also interesting to note that the film is based on a true story about a woman who went into hiding after her daughter was murdered by her husband. So if you have any doubts about whether or not you should watch this film, don't worry, you won't be disappointed.
14294	0	This light hearted comedy should be avoided it all cost for entertainment value. It gets quite hysterically funny at times, but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it erupts.The cast of characters don't meld well together and are quite unbelievable in their roles. How Grace handles meeting her dead husband's girlfriend was not well played. She's not a true lady. And, the worse thing is Grace's white pimp suit that she wears.I highly would not recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud or who cheers for the underdog.  Just watch something different.	1	This light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value.

It seems to me that this may have been the worst motto of some of the least eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the hate for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. The result is a dismal collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on an overwhelming stroll through Parisian arrondissements, unhuman feelings, yearnings with many expectations.Always some other quarter, always some utterly dull story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris je t'aime is about vast array of hate- hate for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the least to us but are no longer around, hate that needs rekindling, unkind hate for that stranger as your eyes meet, or a love that just cannot be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?This film is not solely about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. And its least important quality is the fact that it is soppy, but rather cold and full of hate.I give this film a 2 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories will never develop, and that is the thing that I find missing, and by ""never develop"" I do mean some specific reference to the characters' future. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- boring. Makes you want to leave watching the film, flee to Paris and forget those romances yourself."	1	"Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other.

There is nothing wrong with it. But there is something wrong with the way it was made. In my opinion, it should have been directed by Jean-Luc Godard instead of Rudyard Kiplings.

Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as ""The Bagman"". Who will survive?

The biggest strength of this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen a more capable actor. How this person is not always in a film or on television, I cannot imagine. In my opinion she would even be successful as a greeter at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this high level of talent involved in even low paying roles, does beg the question...... ""What can't she do""? I very much can't imagine seeing this film re-made with anyone else. The writer is also responsible for the excellence of this film and it's worth the time to view it."	0	"Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments.

This was one of the main reasons why I did not give this film an 8 out of 10. If you look at some of the scenes from the beginning of the movie, you will notice that there is a lot of CGI going on. It seems like they wanted to show off the effects of their new technology. However, if you look at the end of the movie you will see that all of the CGI has been removed. The only thing that remains is the sound effects. The music is okay but nothing really stands out. The acting is decent but nothing special. Overall, I gave this film a 9 out of 10 because of the quality of the story and characters.
21268	1	"Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and he's come to London to buy coal in ""Confidential Agent,"" a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists.This film has its good and not so good points. It rates high for atmosphere and for suspense, and it is highly entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is mean, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix appropriately pathetic, and Seymour outrageously wonderful.The not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Boyer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat miscast. Her acting isn't up to snuff either; she's better in other films. But she's an astonishing looking woman, and much can be forgiven.Paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. Seymour wasn't a small actor.Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws."	0	"Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and he's come to London to buy coal in ""Confidential Agent,"" a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix.

I don't want to give too much away, but this is one of those movies where you just have to see it to believe it. In fact, if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it now. It's very well done, and there's a lot to like about it. Boyer plays Luis Denard (played by Hugh Bonneville), a young man who comes to London from Spain to work as a coal miner. He gets caught up in a conspiracy against the Fascists, and ends up on the run from the police. Boyer does a fine job portraying Denard, though he doesn't quite live up to his reputation as a hard-boiled detective. There's a lot of tension between Boyer and the rest of the cast, which is understandable because Boyer is such a talented actor. However, Boyer's portrayal of Denard is rather weak. Boyer seems to be trying too hard to make Denard seem like a sympathetic character. Boyer tries to portray Denard as someone who wants nothing more than to help his people, but Boyer fails miserably at this. Boyer spends most of the movie trying to convince himself that he's doing the right thing by helping his people, when in fact he's doing everything in his power to prevent them from getting what they want. Boyer really needs to take a step back and think about what he's doing here. Boyer should have spent more time thinking about why he's doing what he's going to do, instead of trying to justify his actions. Boyer could have gone into detail about how he came to be involved in the conspiracy, or he could have given us a little bit more insight into

The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who ""accidentally"" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was amazing and felt very natural.  We went quickly from one scene to the next without much of a lag in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should  make cameos often.  Show the actors how they should perform their parts. Not that anyone in this movie wasn't great. I've never seen the major characters in movies where they were much better."	0	"Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be made into movies.

It doesn't really have anything to do with Stepehn's books, but it does have something to do with the fact that Stepehn didn't write any of them. There are many things wrong with this movie. For one thing, there isn't a lot of action in the movie. If you want to see some action, you'll have to wait until the last few minutes of the movie. Also, if you're going to watch this movie, you might as well go through the whole thing in one sitting. You won't be able to put it down once you've seen it all. And then there's the fact that the movie takes place in New York City, which is kind of weird because Stepehn lives in Los Angeles. This makes it seem like Stepehn had no idea what he was talking about when he wrote the book. But hey, at least Stepehn knew what he was doing.!

6835	1	I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor seems really interested in this role, which is great as he really elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems really invested, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very expertly written. William Holden is even better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is  well scripted.Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. The music is excellent and Omar Sharif makes one of his many charming cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now).Richard Fleischer has to be commended for directing this so effectively, he was an brilliantly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his strongest movies.	0	I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop.

In fact, if you look at the first few minutes of the movie, you will notice that there is so much going on all at once that it becomes hard to keep track of what is going on. For example, during the opening sequence, there is a shot of a man walking down the street with his back to the camera. When he walks up to the camera, the camera zooms in on his face and then zooms out again when he walks away from the camera. At the end of the film, there is another shot of the same man

The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys.

The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys.

However, there are a couple of things that bother me about this movie. First off, most of the women in this movie look like they came straight out of a porno film. They don't even look like normal girls. Second, there is a scene where a girl gets into a fight with another girl and ends up getting punched in the face. She looks like she got punched in the mouth. Third, there is an entire scene in which a woman tries to seduce a man and ends up having sex with him instead of her boyfriend. Fourth, there are several scenes in which a group of guys try to take advantage of a teenage girl and end up raping her. And lastly, there is one scene where a bunch of guys get into a fight and end up punching each other in the face until one of them dies. All of these scenes make me want to throw up my hands and say ""What the hell is going on here? Why does this movie need to be rated PG-13?"" But I digress. Let's get back to the movie.


Phat Beach is set in New York City in the early 1960s. The main character is a middle-aged white male named John (played by Tom Selleck). He lives in a big house with his wife Mary (played by Jennifer Connelly) and their four children. One day, after work, John goes out to eat with his family. When he comes back home, he finds that his wife has been murdered. He immediately rushes to the police station to report the crime. As soon as he arrives at the station, however, he discovers that the murder"

Having seen most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could have never imagined under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the first shock, I started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character, and I drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality, being emphasized by distorting it. There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. This is not a movie to enjoy, though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity.

While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.Yet for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level.

In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but . . .) The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!! This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try ""Reversal of Fortune"". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson. The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with the ""Gumby"" short, however, it makes for good viewing.

9458	1	Yes, this was pure magic. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA, it's puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And since most of these preconceived notions are to an extent true, EVERY ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? This is the mid west with the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on what is the place I grew up.

It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film, it's very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically good (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret make sense -- they're explained very well. I also liked how the daughter's relationship with a black man wasn't just presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality.

19203	1	I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore I loved how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close.I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... Gojoe has the action, story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. I strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry).	0	I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie.

If you are going to make a horror movie, don't waste your time on something like this.
6599	1	Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. What happens next is kind of great and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty enjoyable and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was great.

Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did decent with what they had. If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll love this one!! I sure did!	It's got some great action scenes, and it has some great character moments as well. However, if you're looking for an action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then this movie isn't for you. There are plenty of other action movies out there that are more serious than this one, so don't waste your money on this one.

However, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll have a nice time watching this disgustingly sweet film.Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilled to have company. They dote on him and treat him like one of the family,...and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plot there is. But the film gets low marks for a  dull script and half-decent acting. A really bad little curio from the late 1950s.	1	If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is NOT for you.

You'll love it if you're into that sort of thing. Tony Randall has a lot of great lines in this film, but they don't really add much to the story. Instead, they just serve to make the characters more likable. There's no real chemistry between any of the main characters, and none of them seem to get along with each other at all. It doesn't help that most of the supporting characters are either completely unlikable or downright annoying. I'm not going to go into too much detail here, but suffice it to say that some of the jokes are pretty funny, but others aren't so much as funny at all. In fact, many of the jokes feel like they were written by someone who didn't know what they were talking about when they wrote them. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does detract from the overall enjoyment

When I heard the title of the film, I thought it was going to be...different, perhaps in not such a good way.But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually excited about seeing it. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.The film follows Jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. I won't give away what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism.The directing is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.All in all, I give this great film 9 out of 10, for going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve.	0	I'll come clean.

You will be disappointed.


If you're like me, you probably already know what I'm talking about when it comes to this movie. This movie is terrible.


First off, let me start by saying that I am not a huge fan of horror movies. I mean, sure, there are some great ones out there, but they tend to fall into two categories: comedies and action/thriller films. Horror movies tend to lean more towards the comedy side of things, while action/thrillers tend to skew more towards the thrillers side of things. That being said, this movie falls somewhere in the middle.


Let me tell you why.


In the beginning of the movie, Ray (Bill Nighy) goes on a date with Karen (Kathryn Hahn). She seems nice enough, but she doesn't seem like the type of girl you'd want to spend your life with. She's pretty, but she's not very attractive. She's also kind of shy, which isn't something you would expect from someone who works at a fast food restaurant.


So Ray invites her over to his house for dinner. At first glance, it seems like a great idea."

I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she even watched the original movie. The acting isn't even convincing. Please save yourselves, under no circumstances watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off.

The film has some great action sequences but they don't hold your attention as much as the rest of the film. There are some great moments in the film such as the opening sequence where the camera zooms in on a group of people sitting around a campfire watching a football game. It's a nice touch and makes me want to go back and watch it all over again.


The movie is okay. End Game isn't bad by any"

I seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could've looked at that final scene and thought, ""yeah! now there's an ending!"" and patted themselves on the back about it. To me it seemed more like they just ran out of ideas! They built up the final scenes to have a cool twist, but instead just let the whole build-up fall flat on it's face. When the last shot faded to black and I heard the credit music starting I was in shock - I could not believe what I was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending.

The funny jokes in this film bring great laughter, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in today's great comedies. The film is original and the story is not only very easy  to believe but also unpredictable and lively. The characters are extremely engaging and not at all stereotyped.

300	0	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. That's Greenaway's big problem.

He's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.	1	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying hard to entertain his viewers.

1805	1	With a cast that boasts such reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland yields a great sense of depth to this film. It goes beneath the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Kilmer is outstanding as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both perfectly cast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. Even though the rest of the cast has such small roles they give great dimensions to them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton.	0	Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film. It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively.

There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can't even begin to list them all. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be when it comes to telling its story. For example, one of the best scenes in the movie occurs at the very beginning of the film when we learn about the events that led up to the murder of Mrs. Holmes. This scene is so well done that it makes me want to watch the entire movie over and over again just to see how it plays out. Another thing that really bothers me about this movie is the fact that there are so many characters that don't seem to have any real
20636	1	This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film.

About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. hot sex scenes to follow. Why are they hot, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course the girls in that one are very cute. Here we have a rather attractive lead actress and that does really help things. If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vsion that is going to make me enjoy the film. The sex scenes range from romance to hot...I mean there is a no  snake in one of them people. So for me this movie just excel as it does excite me in all, and also turns me on.	0	Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre.

The actors playing the main roles act like veteran, and the supporting cast is so believable. There are more plot in the script (more of it)...A really fantastic movie, and a great talented director."	I don't want to say that this movie is bad, because it is not. It is very good, but it is not great. The acting is excellent, the cinematography is beautiful, the music is wonderful, the sound effects are amazing, the special effects are fantastic, the writing is brilliant, the editing is superb, the story is gripping, the characters are likable, the plot twists are clever, the ending is satisfying, the dialogue is well written, the soundtrack is outstanding, the production values are top notch, and the overall quality of the movie is above average. A must see for anyone who wants to learn how to make movies.

13757	0	An unconventional historical drama, with some mediocre battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives a boring performance, and gets some pretty lame back-up. The script is barely literate and far from original, and the film is kept unfortunately free of heroes. That said, it does drag a lot, and the last reel is too much like a TV mini-series. Plus, Frederick Elmes's camerawork keeps one confused throughout the film (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for David Lynch). Not worth seeing.	1	An unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up.

There are some great moments in this movie, but they're few and far between. I'm not sure if that's due to the quality of the camera work, or just the fact that there are so many interesting characters in this movie. It's hard to know what to make of it all, but it's definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.

There are so many problems with this film that it's hard to know where to begin. First off, there is absolutely no explanation for what happened on the night of September 11th, 2001. It doesn't make any sense at all. Why would anyone do such a thing? And why would anyone want to kill thousands of innocent people? What did they think they were going to get out of it? Did they really think they'd be able to take down the World Trade Center? No. They thought they'd get away with it. But they didn't. In fact, they got away with it far worse than they ever could have imagined.And then there is the whole issue of 9/11 itself. We're supposed to believe that Osama bin Laden was responsible for 9/11. Well, he wasn't. He had nothing to do with 9/11 whatsoever. Not even remotely. Bin Laden was never involved in 9/11 at all. He was just a guy who wanted to blow up the Twin Towers because he saw them as symbols of American power and wealth. That's it. Nothing more.Nothing more. Nothing less. If you

The cast played very poorly, too, and I disliked the script following Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she isn't very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I disliked the film and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.	1	I was especially delighted that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always.

There are many things wrong with it, but most of them can be explained by the fact that it is based on a novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien (who also wrote Lord of the Rings). However, if you read the book, you will see that there is no connection between the two characters. In fact, they don't even share the same last name. They are completely different people who live in different worlds. This is one of the main reasons why I liked the book better than the movie. It doesn't make sense to me that Desdemona would want to sleep with Othello, since he has already killed her father. Also, when Othello says that he wants to marry Cassio, he does not mean that he wants his daughter to marry him. He means that he wants her to marry

Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, but sadly didn't live up to my expectations.Atlantis is supposedly a more ""mature"" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is supposed to be fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, usually containing some reminder of harshness, became only slightly more intriguing until the cliche paradise itself is reached. The presentation of Atlantis' predictable landscape and setting, without some upbeat song, gave the kingdom a pretty mediocre appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations, fails to add to this and doesn't really work.Also, with some of the scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there is a lot of that ""childish"" element that I associate with Disney films. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis, as Milo the outsider  was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. Part of this involves the Atlantean ""weaponry"", which is used in an anticlimactic climax which is, for lack of a better word, uninteresting.Granted, some of the story makes sense, but the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects. Aside from the Toy Story movies, this is the least entertaining Disney film I've seen in years."	1	"While I have a great respect for Disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what I would call ""must-see"".

Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.	1	I saw previews of this movieand  I thought that it may be great.

In addition, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing.

There are a lot of things wrong with Eden's Curve. For one thing, it does not seem to understand what it is trying to do. It seems to be trying to make a statement about the nature of human sexuality, but it doesn't seem to know what it is saying at all. It tries to paint a picture of an idealized world in which everyone is happy and everything is perfect, but it fails miserably here. This is not to say that Eden's Curve did not try its best to capture the spirit of the 60's and 70's, but it just didn't quite get it right. Also, for me, Eden's Curve seemed to focus too much on sex and not enough on other aspects of life such as love, friendship, family, work, religion, politics, etc. All of these things are important parts of who we are as human beings and should be part of our lives, but Eden's Curve failed to give them any real depth. Finally, I think Eden's Curve missed the mark by focusing too much on drug use and alcohol abuse. These are issues that need to be dealt with, but they are not the main focus of the film. Eden's Curve also misses the mark by failing to address the issue of gender identity. As I mentioned earlier, most of the characters in Eden's Curve identify as male or female, but none of them identify as straight or gay.

Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it poorly. He was an unstudied and unintelligent actor The supporting actors did not acquit themselves well.

It unequivocally does.As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who manages to outshine the vets all around her.

Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest.Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark.However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's badly out of tune.The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long.Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection.Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.	1	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written.

Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment ""big dummy that I am."" Plot is so complex that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most lackluster ever filmed. That scene alone is worth leaving the theater. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet unrealistic character. No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond. Everyone should miss this picture."	1	"Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies.

There are some really great moments in this movie, like the chase scene at the end of the movie where we get to see well-known characters from the past come back to life. But there are also some terrible ones, such as the ending sequence where all the dead bodies are piled up on top of each other in the middle of the parking lot of the carnival. If you're going to watch this movie, make sure you take care of your eyes first.

It's pretty much crap, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""terrible, just terrible."" Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."	1	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days.

"Because Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home was originally supposed to be the last season of the original series, it would have made sense for the writers to go back to the source material and re-do some of the episodes that didn't make it into the final product. Instead, they decided to do a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't even in the final version of the film. For example, there's a scene where Captain Kirk and Uhura are walking down the corridors of the USS Enterprise-D when they come across a group of Klingons. One of the Klingons asks them if they're all Klingons, and one of them replies, ""No, we're all Romulans,"" which makes no sense"

Secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.	1	OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed sometime after the 80s I was mildly surprised to find out it was released in 2001.

I think it was an attempt to rip off The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies, but it failed miserably to do this.The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling out the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. Skip it."	1	"One of the best movies I ever saw. My only thought was: ""when can I purchase my own copy"". This is worth way more than four dollars. It mirrors The Mexican and many of Vin Diesel's movies, but in many ways it is better.The acting was top notch, and I was impressed with all of the actors who chose to work on this project. The story was captivating.  The movie had me entranced, and it was very unpredictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was spot on, and I could have mistaken her for a native Spanish speaker.

It boasts a mediocre cast, who ham the play up for all they're worth, especially Askey, of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.  The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone comes off as ghastly dull.  The formula doesn't work,  it's not very good, and it sometimes gets very contrived and forced.  This makes the film seem more dated than it is.  But those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any God Britain hasn't got any nowadays! Ultimately this is a harmless film  to welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed!	1	Now this is one of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch.

I have never seen a movie like this before. It is so much fun to watch these two women get into bed with each other. You can't help but feel sorry for them at the end of the movie when they realize that their relationship was doomed from the start. They had no idea how badly they were going to screw each other until they started having sex.

18119	1	I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring Columbo to me. After a few times, I get bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. I don't know. Maybe I just didn't care for this one at all. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It's just the question of how.	0	I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a very boring Columbo to me.

For starters, there is not enough time for any of the characters to really develop. Ray Milland doesn't seem to have developed as much as he did in the first two movies. His character seems to be stuck in a rut where he has nothing to do and no one to talk to about it. Then again, Ray Milland isn't supposed to be a detective. He's supposed to be someone who wants to help people. So what does he do? Well, he goes out into the world and tries to figure out what happened to his wife. That's it. Nothing more. No development whatsoever. When Ray Milland finally comes to terms with his wife's death, he decides to go back to the police department and try to solve the case. Unfortunately, he ends up getting involved in a lot of shady business and ends up losing his job because of it. Not only does he lose his job, he

In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema won't find things to relate on. The screenplay is not very compelling and full of ugly characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the worst performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero awfully, failing to make us feel his broken heart in each line, in each move. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the worst actors of all time in one of the simplest and also least realistic performances in his career.

18755	0	This is an extraordinarily bad film, that bores you constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something will happen that genuinely is a cliche. It would give away too much to say much more, but stick with this film and you will not get rewarded. William Haines is absolutely pathetic - he is certainly not a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is disgusting - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text poorly and with a lack of depth of emotion so that there are moments that are very contrived. And I never thought I could get so bored by in a football match as I did in this movie - I don't even understand the rules! Also stinking it up is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Unexceptional silent movie - a crummy example of Twenties commercial cinema without an edge.	1	This is an extraordinary film, that tricks you constantly.

18916	0	Of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my most hated characters. I just hate the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and emulate characters etc etc. I hate the scene when a stone cracks in Kader khans mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. That's the worst scene of the film. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is bad chemistry between two great Indian actors doing a comical scene with bad dialogue. It's a cat and mouse film. Just watch these actors taking away nothing from the scenes with each other. It's totally not entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan, miss this movie. I think RB is worst in my list of movies by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein','Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1' are all better than this film. 3/10.	1	Of course if you are reading my review you have seen this film already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my most favorite characters. I just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch movies and emulate characters etc etc. I love the scene when a stone cracks in Kader khans mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. Thats my favorite scene of the film. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great Indian actors doing a comical scene with no dialogs. Its brilliant. It's a cat mouse film. Just watch these actors helping each other and still taking away the scene from each other. Its total entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry then its a must. I think RB is 6th in my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein','Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1' precedes this gem of a film. 7/10.	You will love it. But don't expect anything special from it. 4/10.

I think for the time (60's) this was a very well done version of Hamlet but cannot compare to Branagh's complete version.just a note... I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows of one please tell me."	1	"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a great experience.This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia.

It's where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story. The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make. The Matrix is finally the film equivalent. The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non-action sequences in SciFi. While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel. Watch for eye candy, not for deep thought.4 out of 10, as registered by this fine website.	1	It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels.

It seems like in SciFi you have these periodic throwbacks to perform an even more odd phenomenon that occurs in short serial novels. In fact, it's one of the reasons why I'm a huge fan of sci-fi films. There are so many different ways to tell a story, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about sci-fi is how it allows us to create our own worlds. We don't have to follow the same formula every time we watch a movie. We can create our own stories without having to adhere to any formula at all. This is especially true when it comes to science fiction. If you're looking for a great sci-fi movie, look no further than Blade Runner.

Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. I'd watch it again though. I rated it a 5 (wish I could rate it a 5.5)	1	I love the cast pretty and the story sort of unfolds rather timely. Danny Glover does a fantastic job making you wonder if he's the bad guy.

This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time.Plot- A family without a mother and 3 ""dads"" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie.

I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it's obviously a style of film that Americans haven't really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...	1	Have I ever seen a film more shockingly bold?

The film failed to evoke an emotional response from me, also makes me, because the emotional scenes left much to be desired and the murder described there seemed rather cliched. It really isn't worth watching.	1	I've watched this movie twice, and I plan to see it again. It is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in Israel. It also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was, and the horrible murder described there. It is really worth watching.	There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, but let's start with the fact that it was directed by a man who has never made a movie before. His previous films have been mediocre at best, and he doesn't seem to know how to make movies anymore. He seems to have lost touch with reality, which is why we don't get any real emotion from him. This time around, however, he manages to create something very interesting, even if

I think many so-called action movies copied a lot many ""escape scenes"" from this movie!! And not only does it never impress me when I see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The lead actors have acted wonderfully. The slow and realistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. I recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance!! --Vijay."	0	"I had seen this movie when it got released, and when I was 12 years old :( And I still vividly recollect the over-dramatic scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :( And the worst feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain!

First of all, there is no romance between the two main characters. Secondly, there is a scene where one of the villains tries to seduce the heroine by telling her that he loves her but she doesn't want to hear it. Thirdly, there is another scene where the hero has to save his girlfriend from being killed by an angry mob. Fourthly, there's a scene where the heroine saves her boyfriend from being murdered by a gang of thugs. Fifthly, there are several scenes where the hero gets into a fight with a group of thugs who are trying to kill him. Sixthly, there isn't any dialogue between the hero and the heroine. Seventhly, there aren't any dialogues between the heroine and the hero. Eighthly, there seems to be a plot twist at the end of the movie. Ninthly, the ending of the movie is too abrupt.

Here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. No, these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! Not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Dungeons and Dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month.	1	One of the things this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood.

22421	0	Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.	1	Joe Don Baker is a good actor in several roles...he was excellent in Goldeneye and made a great Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies.

There are a lot of things wrong with this movie. First of all, Joe Don doesn't seem to have any sense of humor whatsoever. He seems to think that if he says something funny, people will laugh at him. In fact, most of the jokes in this movie aren't funny at all. Most of the jokes come from Joe Don trying to figure out who the killer is and why he did what he did. For example, Joe Don tries to figure out where the killer got off the plane and finds out that the killer didn't get off the plane because he had his hands tied behind his back. Joe Don thinks that if he tells the killer ""I'm going to kill you"", he will get off the boat and go home. Well, guess what? Joe Don does not tell the killer that he is going to kill him. Instead, Joe Don tells the killer: ""You're going to pay for your sins."" And then Joe Don goes after the killer and beats him up until he is unconscious. Then Joe Don takes the killer's knife and stabs the killer in the head several times. Finally, Joe Don gives the killer a piece of paper"

This is a no-sense movie, one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage. Do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting? I wonder... The soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture. God!...	1	This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen!

Forgettable parts include his walking, talking and speaking english, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.

22425	1	A great heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).	0	A not bad but also not so great heist film.

I had read so many good reviews on this movie and I get where these reviews have came from,I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, the budget they had was not a problem, there were two cameras used in the entire film (which was OK)and t they seemed like really high quality cameras. Another plus was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other - and it was still possible to hear what they're saying.It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have little chance to escape, and don't!

It is easy to confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz which gets equally poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. He sets off to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. I won't spoil the end because it's so predictable and bad. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a loss to moviedom.	1	It was released in France on dvd several years ago--I wish it would be re-released with English subtitles.

In fact, most of the action takes place during the first half of the movie. However, the second half of the film does have some great moments. For example, there is a scene where Gerard tries to convince Gina to marry him. She says she doesn't want to go through with it because she wants to spend more time with her family. This is one of the best scenes in the entire movie. Then there is another scene where Gerard tells Gina that he loves her and that she should marry him. Again, this is one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie. Finally, there is also a scene where Gina kisses Gerard
22428	0	Here’s a film straight out of my childhood nightmares.  My family taped it, but someone (who me?) taped over it.  I was unfortunate enough now to discover it on youtube.com.  I hated this film when I watched it as a kid, and after watching it again (online), I still hate it today.  The worse song from the movie is “Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers”; it will stay in my mind and torment me forever. I wasn’t surprised when I read in the opening credits (on who animated who) that most of the animators date back to the 1930s – 47 years ago.	1	"Now here's a film straight out of my childhood, my family used to taped; but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years. Now I was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com; I had love this wonderful film when I watched it as kid, and after watching again (online), I still do today. My favorite song from the movie is ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" (I will always remember that sweet song forever). I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (on who animated who),that some of the animators date back to 1930s (WOW! that's like 47 years)."	It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good. There are some really great moments in the movie, like the scene where we learn how to ride a bicycle, or the one where we learn to drive a car. However, there are also some really terrible moments, like the one where our hero gets shot in the face with a BB gun while trying to save his girlfriend from being run over by a truck.  I don't want to spoil too much of the movie for you, but if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a watch.
